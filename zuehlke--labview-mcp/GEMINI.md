# Working in this repository

Rules that came out of building this server, written down so they survive a new machine and a
fresh session. They are not style preferences — each one is here because ignoring it cost real
work.

## Agents first

**LabVIEW work is DELEGATED to the matching `labview-*` agent, not done in the main session.**
The user's standing rule of 2026-09-27. Work directly only when the user asks for it in that
session.

| Request | Agent |
|---|---|
| a new VI | `labview-vi-generator` |
| implement a SUPPLIED VI whose front panel must be kept (exam template) | `labview-vi-generator` - pass the supplied VI; it grafts (Phase 6g) |
| change an existing VI | `labview-vi-editor` |
| a class, class hierarchy or interface | `labview-class-generator` |
| unit tests (default framework) | `labview-caraya-unit-test` |
| LUnit / VI Tester tests, only when named | `labview-lunit-unit-test` / `labview-vitester-unit-test` |
| documentation | `labview-doc-generator` |
| a DQMH module or event | `labview-dqmh-module` |

The reason is what the agent definitions carry: a session working directly never reads them, and
a rule that lives only there is invisible to it — twelve German comments and sixteen German
descriptions shipped exactly that way (see "Everything you write INTO a VI is English"). Relay an
agent's `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` block to the user verbatim and continue THAT agent via
`SendMessage`; never answer it on the user's behalf. Parallel agents share one LabVIEW, so the
project-open/close and swap rules under "ONE AGENT, ONE OUTPUT DIRECTORY" apply to every
multi-agent task.

## Generating LabVIEW code

**First decide what kind of thing you are looking for.** This routing question comes before any
lookup, and getting it wrong sends you to the wrong index and makes you conclude "there is no
function for this":

| What you want | Construct | Where to look |
|---|---|---|
| a **whole working diagram** — a state machine, a producer/consumer, "how do I stream to TDMS" | a shipping example to read and adapt | `lvai_example_index` |
| a computation on **data** — read a file, sort, parse, compare | primitive `Node`, or a subVI `Call` | `lvai_palette_index`; terminal names from an export |
| a **property or action of a LabVIEW object** — a VI, control, panel, project, the application | `Property Node` / `Invoke Node` | `lvai_vi_server_reference` |
| a **whole application skeleton** — producer/consumer, a dialog, a subVI stub | an NI `.vit` template, copied to a `.vi` | `templates\Frameworks\DesignPatterns\`; `docs/labview-vit-templates.md` |
| a **VI's icon** | neither — AIXML cannot carry one | `lvai_set_vi_icon`, which drives VI Server for you |

The second row is the one that gets forgotten. "Get this VI's icon", "list a project's items",
"is this VI broken", "read a control by name", "what does this VI call" are none of them functions
and will never appear in a palette — they are properties and methods, and the catalogue is the only
index for them.

**Check whether NI already built it, before designing anything.** `lvai_example_index` lists the
shipping examples of this installation with NI's own description and keywords, and needs no
running LabVIEW. It answers a different question from the palette index — that one says *which VI
may I call*, this one says *is this whole diagram already written*. Feed a hit's path to
`lvai_convert_vi_to_aixml` and read how NI wired it.

Two numbers worth knowing before you call it. **609 of the 951 examples are listed by default**:
the rest need LabVIEW FPGA, LabVIEW Real-Time or a licensed toolkit, and a hit you cannot open is
worse than no hit. The count held back is always reported; `includeSpecialised` shows them.
And the index is **cached on disk and warmed at start-up**, so calls cost about 176 ms — but the
first ever build on a machine reads 2510 files and takes **about 50 seconds**. This file used to
claim 400 ms flatly; that was the warm figure, and before the cache existed every server restart
brought the full minute back.

The cache never expires on its own. After installing or upgrading LabVIEW or an add-on, rebuild it
once — `refresh=true`, or `LabVIEWMCP --examples --refresh` — because nothing else will notice.
Every answer carries the cache's build date, so a stale index is visible rather than mysterious.

Do this first for anything pattern-shaped: state machines, producer/consumer, queued message
handlers, continuous acquisition, file streaming. `State Machine Fundamentals.vi` is thirty seconds
of reading and it is the canonical shape.

**Reading an example is cheap the second time; reading your own VI never is.** An export costs a
median of 331 ms, a p99 of 24 s and a worst case of 93 s, measured over 1677 VIs — and the time
goes on LabVIEW loading the VI, not on writing XML, so a big export is not a slow one (size and
duration correlate at r = 0.002). `lvai_convert_vi_to_aixml` caches exports of **installation**
VIs on disk under **`%USERPROFILE%\.labviewmcp\cache\aixml`** — the examples tree, `vi.lib`,
`user.lib` and every LVAddon. Your own code is deliberately never cached: an export depends on the
VI's subVIs too, and those change behind a caller whose own timestamp never moves. Every answer
says which happened in `fromCache` and `cacheNote`; `refresh` re-exports. §10 of
`lvai_aixml_reference` has the rest.

**The cache is NOT under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`** — this line said so until 2026-08-13 and it sent that
session to an empty folder, from which it concluded "no AIXML cache on this machine" and stopped
using it while 2 382 exports sat in the real location. It moved because a server launched by the
Claude desktop app inherits that app's filesystem redirection, which turns anything under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%` into the package's private store; `%USERPROFILE%` is not redirected, so every host
now sees one cache. `LABVIEWMCP_CACHE_DIR` relocates it, and `CacheDirectory.Root` is the authority —
ask the code, not a document, if the two ever disagree again. The practical consequence for a session: browsing several
examples to find the right shape is not expensive, so browse.

**Triaging several candidates is one call, not one per candidate.** `lvai_convert_vis_to_aixml`
takes a list of VIs, one path per line, and writes them into one directory: cached exports come
back concurrently, uncached ones go through LabVIEW one at a time. That split is not a compromise,
it is the measurement — **six generate calls issued together took 559 ms against 543 ms one after
another**, so LabVIEW serialises the work and fanning out `lvai_*` calls for throughput gains
nothing while risking one slow VI blocking the rest. Anything that never reaches LabVIEW does
parallelise: file reading is about 21x concurrent on a cold tree, which is why both indexes and
the batch export are built that way.

**A hit may be a `.lvproj`, not a VI** — 29 of them, whole example applications such as
`Active Noise Control (cRIO).lvproj`. For those the follow-up is `lvai_describe_project`;
`lvai_convert_vi_to_aixml` is the wrong call and no `.lvproj` carries in-VI metadata, so they reach
the index only through the external registration path.

One limit remains, and the tool reports it rather than leaving it to be discovered: a VI absent
from the index may still have a description, because `lvai_filter_example_search_candidates` reads
any VI's description property, including `vi.lib`. Formats and measurements in
`docs/example-corpus.md`.

**Reuse a palette VI before you rebuild anything.** Query `lvai_palette_index` for the operation
*before* designing a diagram; it is the searchable catalogue of what this station has. **A hit in
that index is the design — use it.** The palette path printed beside each hit
(`Categories\OpenG\functions_oglib_string.mnu`) is the proof that this station has that VI.
Rebuilding logic from primitives is the fallback, used only when the index has no hit *and* the
target genuinely fails to resolve — and say which of the two it was.

The mistake this prevents: an empty-string filter was hand-built from a For loop, a Case
structure, a shift register and `Build Array` — seven elements — because a `Call` to a
library-owned VI was believed to be rejected. It is not.
`openg_array.lvlib:Filter 1D Array__ogtk.vi` validated, generated, ran, and produced
byte-identical output in three nodes.

**A MISS IN THE INDEX IS NOT PROOF THAT A CALL IS ILLEGAL.** This clause used to end "the boundary
is palette reachability, not library membership", and that is the *second* wrong answer this rule
has had. Measured 2026-08-27 over eight probes: generation resolves a target **by name against what
the installation can find**, and the palette has nothing to do with it. A library member resolves
by its qualifier with no palette entry (`Caraya.lvlib\3AVI Name.vi`); a loose VI in a plain folder
under `vi.lib` or `user.lib` resolves by its bare name with no palette entry and no library. What
does *not* resolve: a VI inside an `.llb` by bare name — which is what the old rule was really
seeing, since most palette VIs live in `.llb`s — a path in any spelling, and project-local code,
loose or in a project library — **unless that code is LOADED, and then only for conversion.**

**PROJECT-LOCAL CODE RESOLVES BY BARE NAME ONCE IT IS OPEN IN LabVIEW — measured 2026-09-25 on
NI's hint, and the sentence above said "does not resolve" flatly until then.** Opened through its
project or opened loose with no project, a subject outside every installation tree was accepted
by `ConvertAIXMLToVI` (`errorCode 0`), the caller ran with the right answer, and it was still
`execState 1` from disk in a FRESH LabVIEW — so the link is written into the file. Not loaded, or
merely a member of an active project, it is `Error 53` as before, three times over. **The reason
nobody saw it: `ValidateAIXML` refuses the same document in every arm.** Two traps come with it:
a FAILED convert burns the caller's `_name` (`1051` on the next convert, the same as a failed
validate), and a convert that fails at `Save:Instrument` with a project active leaves a path-less
VI there that makes the project unclosable (`1019`) until it is saved to a path.

**AND A SAME-NAMED VI FROM AN EARLIER BUILD, STILL IN MEMORY, CAPTURES THE CALL IN SILENCE -
measured 2026-09-25.** On an instance that had run the previous ATM build, a bare-name `Call` to
`Read Accounts File.vi` with NOTHING opened validated `errorCode 0`, converted, ran, and linked to the
PREVIOUS build's file; the tell was `Error 1051` at `Save:Instrument` on a path that had never
existed. A LabVIEW restart released it. So restart LabVIEW between two builds of the same
application, and `grep -a` a generated caller's link paths. `docs/aixml-call-loaded-vi.md` §3.

**AND EVERY VALIDATION LEAVES A SCRATCH VI IN MEMORY THAT NOTHING CAN CLOSE - so there is ONE
validation name now, not one per call.** The user's exit dialog of 2026-09-26 listed 54 unsaved
`LVMCP Validate <hash>.vi`. By name they are in NONE of the instances VI Server reaches (helpers',
IDE main over TCP, active project), with positive controls, and the converter's `1051` does not see
them either - so they cannot be closed afterwards. `ValidationScratch` hands every validation
`LVMCP Validate.vi`; a validation under a reused name answers exactly as a fresh one, measured, and
conversion keeps a unique name because a failed convert burns its own. Whether the exit dialog
shrinks to one entry needs one LabVIEW exit to confirm; "Don't Save - All" there is always safe.
`docs/scratch-vis-in-memory.md`.

**`lvai_generate_vi` TAKES THIS ROUTE BY ITSELF since 2026-09-25**, and so does everything built on
it (`lvai_generate_vis`, the test generators, the class tools). A validate refusal naming ONLY
`Unsupported SubVI` lines is converted anyway — under a throwaway `_name`, so a refusal burns
nothing and the saved VI is still named after its file — with the target folder created first, and
the result is then gated on `lvai_exec_state` in place of the validation that could not look; the
answer carries `loadedSubVIs`. Accepted against LabVIEW over raw stdio: not loaded → `53` naming
the target, then the SAME document and path after opening it → `ok`, `executable: true`, run
correct; a class chain the same. **A misspelt terminal on such a call is `Error 1` from the
generator, not a broken VI** — the converter refuses it and writes nothing — and the answer says
which of the three failure shapes it was, because only the Save-time one leaves the `1019` orphan.

**`lvai_generate_test` CALLS ITS SUBJECT DIRECTLY by default since the same day** — it finds the
`.lvproj` that LISTS the subject, opens it there, names the subject in the `Call`, generates and
closes the project; the placeholder route is the fallback, and `route` in the answer says which
ran and why. Accepted through a real Caraya run with a failing control. **It is NOT faster inside
the call** (15.7 s against 13.6–15.9 s) — the gain is fewer moving parts, and it passes a case the
placeholder route FAILS: a test VI in a different folder from its subject, where the pylabview
retarget leaves `Missing subVI` and `execState 0`. `docs/labview-unit-testing.md` §3. It lists the
test under `testFolderName` (default `Tests`) since the same day, where it used to leave it wherever
LabVIEW's save dropped it.

**A WHOLE CLD EXAM HAS NOW BEEN BUILT WITH NO STUB AND NO pyLabVIEW** - the ATM, 2026-09-25,
five agents, thirteen VIs, Caraya 50/0, audited from the transcripts and the stub folder rather than
from the agents' reports. The one design cost is the Event Structure, whose registration is still
pyLabVIEW work, so that build polled instead. The shape that makes it work with parallel agents is
by DEPENDENCY: leaf VIs in parallel with no project opened, then ONE agent opens the callees and
generates the callers. **And a line break in a generated `value` is `&#10;`** - a raw one is
normalised to a space by the XML parser, which silently broke every multi-line test expectation
until `EscapeValue` wrote the reference. `docs/cold-build-atm-no-stubs.md`.

**`lvai_generate_class_test` CALLS THE ACCESSORS DIRECTLY too** — one accessor opened through the
class's project makes every member callable, each pair's terminal names are read off its export
(a typedef-bound field's data terminal is named after the TYPEDEF, not the field), and the test
calls the real accessors. **The seed `path` constant and its `{LV.Constant}` `Replace` stay**: the
converter writes the path into the class input as a broken wire, and the Replace turns it into the
class — measured `eBad` before, `execState 1` after. Sockets and node swaps go. Accepted through
Caraya on an `int32` and a typedef field; **for ONE field it is not faster** (18.0 s against
11.9 s + a 7.4 s project open), and the per-field saving is not measured. `docs/labview-unit-testing.md` §3d.

**`lvai_generate_method_test` CALLS THE METHODS AND ACCESSORS DIRECTLY as well**, same shape: the
method's class and error terminals are read by TYPE off the export the tool already makes for the
required inputs, the seed `Replace` stays, and a case the method cannot serve (a wire-survival case
on a method that returns no object) is REFUSED before anything is written instead of generating a
suite that cannot run. Accepted through Caraya with a failing control arm, and **here it IS faster —
15.8 s against 26.2 s** for four cases, because the sockets' swap also needs the project opened
first. The test is generated with the project open, so LabVIEW's save adopts it at target level
on every run — and the listing step now MOVES that entry into `testFolderName`, because it was not
in the project before the call. **The discriminator is time, not place**: a VI listed anywhere
BEFORE the call, target level included, is someone's choice and stays (`listedElsewhere`); only
the entry this call's own save made is moved (`movedIntoFolder`). `docs/class-method-tooling.md`
§3d and D2.

**CLASS MEMBERS RESOLVE THE SAME WAY, and a `.ctl` does NOT — measured the same day.** Opening ONE
member of a class through its project made `X.lvclass\3AMethod.vi` resolvable for every member;
a caller chaining a static `New` method into a dynamic-dispatch `Write` and `Read` converted, ran
(`42` in, `42` out) and was still executable in a fresh LabVIEW. Class wires between the calls need
nothing — no `path` stand-in, no swap. A `.ctl` open through its project is refused as a `Call`
target and has no `type=` spelling at all (`Unrecognized or unsupported attribute set`), and a
control merely labelled like it is not bound to it. So a constant feeding a typedef input still
arrives bare with a coercion dot, and `lvai_bind_typedef_constants` still repairs it — measured on
this route with the value kept. **The test generators run that repair themselves since 2026-09-25**
(a `typedefConstants` step), and thirteen AIXML spellings for a typedef constant were refused with the
`.ctl` loaded - `docs/cold-build-typedef-gdevcon.md` §4. Project-library members are the one target kind not measured yet.
`docs/aixml-call-loaded-vi.md`.

**The index used to compound this by being incomplete, and that is FIXED as of 2026-09-07.** It
scanned `menus\` and `LVAddons\` only, so a `.mnu` anywhere else was invisible — a query for
`Caraya` answered "no match" for VIs that validate and run. Sweeping the whole installation found
**157 `.mnu` files outside every `menus` folder**, and reading them took the index from 582 palette
files to **743**, and from 2 835 VIs to **3 335 — 500 more, 15 % of the catalogue**:

| tree | new VIs | what was missing |
|---|---|---|
| `vi.lib` | 404 | Caraya, VI Tester, JSONtext, Wovalab, and NI's own 3D Picture Control, SFTP, SSH |
| `instr.lib` | 71 | **every instrument driver** — this station has one real one plus nine `_Template` skeletons, so a real test rig yields far more |
| `user.lib` | 25 | OpenG, and whatever the user installed |
| `Targets` | 0 | its FPGA palettes carry `.ctl` controls, which the index filters out |

`Caraya` now answers 94 hits, `Assert Almost Equal_Float.vi` among them — the VI an earlier session
wanted and could not discover. `menus\` is still read FIRST, so a VI in both trees keeps its
menus-relative label; the rest are labelled `vi.lib: <path>`, `instr.lib: <path>`.

**Scanned BROADLY — each tree whole — rather than at the `addons` folders the pattern suggests**,
because NI's 3D Picture, SFTP and SSH palettes are under neither, and "palette files live under a
folder called X" is a convention this scanner has now been caught by twice. The cost is a directory
walk, not a read: only the 157 `.mnu` files are opened, and the scan went from ~148 ms to ~218 ms
against ~110 ms from the cache.

**One `.mnu` is deliberately left out**: `resource\plugins\PopupMenus\…\Class Methods Shortcut
Palette.mnu` is a right-click menu, not a palette of callable VIs, and feeding IDE menu actions
into a catalogue of `Call` targets is the plausible-but-wrong string this index exists to avoid.

Search the index to *find* something; settle a target spelling with a throwaway `ValidateAIXML`.
Full table in §9 of `lvai_aixml_reference`.

**The practical prize is a placeholder you generate yourself, and `lvai_placeholder_subvi` does
it.** Because a loose VI under `user.lib` is callable by bare name, AIXML can be given a call node
it is allowed to create — and pylabview can then point it at your own code, which AIXML can never
target. That is how a generated unit test comes to call its subject as an ordinary subVI.

**A UNIT TEST CALLS ITS SUBJECT AS A STATIC SUBVI. ALWAYS. Never drive it through VI Server.** This
holds for CLASS code too, where it looks impossible: AIXML refuses a class-typed terminal, so a
generated test cannot name an accessor — but LabVIEW's own `{LV.SubVI}` `Replace` puts one into a
node AIXML *was* allowed to create, and unlike a pylabview link retarget it **re-types the wires**,
so the two panes need not match. Author the test against a socket whose class terminals are `path`
stand-ins, then swap. Measured 2026-08-29 over twelve properties of a three-class hierarchy:
`failures="0"`, with a negative control that fails on demand.

The VI Server variant — open a reference, `Ctrl Val.Set`, `Run VI`, `Ctrl Val.Get` — also works and
is written up as §3c, and it is **the fallback, not the default**. It was built first in that session
and the user's correction was explicit: *"Du musst die statischen VIs einsetzen bei den tests!"* Three
reasons it loses: the diagram is not what a LabVIEW developer reads, the assertion compares a
formatted string instead of the field's real type, and a renamed field breaks the test at run time
instead of at edit time. Reach for it only when the subject genuinely cannot be linked statically,
and say why.

**The trap that decides whether the static route runs at all: a DYNAMIC DISPATCH INPUT IS A REQUIRED
TERMINAL.** Leave the first accessor's class input unwired and the test is `Error 1003, not
executable` — after the file generated, the swap succeeded and the export looked right. So each chain
needs a class constant, authored as a path constant and converted with `{LV.Constant}` `Replace`
**after** the nodes, never before. Recipe and the other four traps in `docs/labview-unit-testing.md`
§3d.

**A PLACEHOLDER LOSES EVERY TYPEDEF ON THE PANE, and the whole chain stays silent about it.** AIXML
cannot express that a control is an instance of a `.ctl`, so the clone carries the bare underlying
type — and after the retarget every input you wired a constant to sits behind a **coercion dot**.
Validation, the retarget, its verify step, a run and `Bad SubVI Linkage` all pass; measured
2026-08-29 on two strict typedefs (`Control VI Type` = 2). `pylv_route` cannot catch it either: its
Check A validates the export, which validates *precisely because* the typedef is already gone.

So the placeholder route has a third step. `lvai_placeholder_subvi` now reports `typedefTerminals`
up front, `pylv_apply`'s verify reports `coercionDots` after the retarget, `lvai_coercion_dots`
answers the question on demand, and `lvai_bind_typedef_constants` repairs it — deriving each `.ctl`
from the terminal itself, so you pass no paths. **Name every constant you wire into a generated call
after the terminal it feeds** (`<Constant _name="Borkenkaefer" …/>`): AIXML's `_name` becomes the
block diagram label, and the label is how the repair finds the constant. Two boolean constants are
otherwise indistinguishable, and `All Objects[]` order is not stable across VIs.

**And wire a constant ONLY where the callee marks the input `required`.** `recommended` and
`optional` inputs stay unwired unless you have a real value; an unwired input keeps the callee's
default. `lvai_vi_terminals` prints the flag per terminal and names the required set. The trap is
that **validation cannot teach you this rule**: AIXML enforces `required` and is silent about the
rest, so "wire what the validator demands" looks like a rule and is only ever accidentally right.
Measured 2026-08-29 — a second call was authored by mirroring the first call's wiring without
re-reading the flags, and was correct only because the terminal was still `required`; changing it
to `recommended` produced no error anywhere and the mirrored constant became surplus. Surplus is
not free on a typedef pane: it has to be bound and kept in step with the `.ctl` as well.

**AND WRITE `connection=` ON EVERY TERMINAL YOU GIVE A `conIdx` — an omitted one means REQUIRED.**
Not "unspecified": measured 2026-09-04 on one three-terminal probe, a Control and an Indicator that
carried no `connection` both came back `required`, beside one that said `recommended` and got it. A
required **output** is never right, and the damage lands in the CALLER: LabVIEW enforces the flag at
the call site, so anyone who leaves the terminal unwired is `Error 1003` while the VI itself opens,
compiles, runs and exports perfectly. It shipped in a generated class method and the first thing that
noticed was a Caraya suite refusing to start — `7101, not in a executable state` — after validation,
conversion, the subVI swap and `lvai_connector_pane` had all passed it. `lvai_check_aixml` now warns
(`outputTerminalDefaultsToRequired`) and repairs the output case to `recommended`, so
`lvai_generate_vi` fixes it in passing; the input case is reported and left alone, because a required
input is a legitimate choice. **On a VI that already exists the fix is `{LV.ConnectorPane}`
`SetWireRule(conIdx, 2)`, not a regeneration** — it moves no terminal, so no caller changes, and it
is the only route for a class member that has since been retyped. Do it in the IDE's application
instance and save the VI *and* its class, or it is a silent no-op. `docs/aixml-reference.md`,
`docs/vi-server-reference.md`.

The one thing the repair does NOT reach is an **output** terminal: nothing is wired into it, so
there is no dot and no constant — the bare type travels into whatever consumes the wire.
`docs/typedef-constants.md` has the measurements, including why `Create Constant` alone is not the
fix and the two traps around `Replace`.

The tool clones the subject's pane, caches the stub in `user.lib\LV_MCP\` under a hash of the
signature, and hands back the `Call` element and the matching `retarget` operation. **Do not hunt
the palette for a stand-in and do not hand-write one**: a borrowed placeholder needs a lucky hit per
signature and forces the SUBJECT's pane to be reshaped, which then breaks on every regeneration —
`7101, At least one test is not in a executable state`, with nothing in the message about panes.

And the clone must be EXACT. Measured on a controlled pair differing only in terminal type: a
Variant stub retargeted onto a `double` subject gives `Error 7, Bad Linkage`; the `double` one runs.
The pane's type descriptor is part of the link binding, so there is no generic placeholder.
`docs/labview-unit-testing.md` §3a.

**But the index prints the bare name, and for a library-owned VI that name is not the target.**
`Draw Image from File__ogtk.vi` is refused; `openg_picture.lvlib\3ADraw Image from
File__ogtk.vi` validates and runs — the same VI. The qualifier is not derivable from what the
index shows: the palette file is `functions_oglib_picture.mnu` and the VI lives in `picture.llb`,
neither of which names `openg_picture.lvlib`. Get it by exporting a VI that already calls the
target, or settle both spellings in one throwaway `ValidateAIXML`. Following the index literally
is the third way this same trap has been sprung — it looks exactly like "this VI is not callable"
and sends you back to primitives.

**A third-party dependency is not a reason to rebuild.** OpenG, MGI and JKI are installed here and
their entries are in the index like any other. Name the dependency in your report — the generated
VI will not open where the package is missing — but name it as information, not as a question, and
call the VI. Avoid a package only where the caller asked for that up front.

This clause used to read "say so and let the caller choose", and that is exactly how it failed:
generating `FileSorter.vi` on 2026-08-07 the index returned `1D Array to String__ogtk.vi`, and the
join was rebuilt from a For loop, a shift register and `Concatenate Strings` anyway, on the grounds
that the caller might not want OpenG. Nobody had asked for that. Second occurrence of the same
mistake — hence the sharper wording.

**Look terminal names up, never guess them.** They are literal LabVIEW labels and several are
surprising (`Increment` → `x+1`, but `Greater?` → `x > y?` with spaces). The reliable move is to
export a VI that already uses the node and copy its exact shape. `lvai_vi_server_reference` covers
Invoke and Property nodes; for primitives, export an example.

**And look them up in one call, not one per node.** `lvai_aixml_reference` takes `node=` as a
comma-separated list; so does `query=` on `lvai_vi_server_reference`. This is not a micro-optimisation
— terms match by substring, so single lookups return the same passage over and over. Generating
`SignalLoader_13.vi` cost 18 separate lookups where 12 of the terms were known the moment the
diagram was sketched, and the 2D-indexing block came back four times. Batched: **21 973 characters
over 18 calls became 13 427 over one, 38.9 % less, with every terminal name still present.** Sketch
the diagram, list its nodes, one call — then a second small batch for what only the validator
reveals, such as `To Time Stamp` for `Build Waveform`'s `t0`.

A cache was the wrong instinct here and is worth remembering as such: no two of those 18 calls had
the same argument, so nothing keyed on the input would have saved a single one. The waste was
duplicated *output*.

**And a batch only helps if each term's answer is aimed, which needed two more fixes on 2026-09-07.**
Both were measured as friction in one class build, and both are about the lookup, not the round trip:

- **A LOOKUP FOR A COMMON WORD RANKS THE WRONG PASSAGES FIRST.** `node='Select'` answered "34
  passages, that term is everywhere - showing 8", and the terminal row was among the eight but
  buried, because every other backticked mention scored the same. **A table row whose FIRST CELL is
  the term now outranks a mention of it** — that row is *about* the term where prose merely uses it,
  and it generalises to every keyed table in every served document.
- **`lvai_aixml_reference section=8` COULD NOT BE READ AT ALL.** 89 521 characters overruns the
  client's output limit, so the whole answer spilled to a file — and a file holding one JSON string
  is not greppable, which cost two extra `grep` calls to find one paragraph. It is also the section
  the document's own multi-terminal rule sends you to. The old code returned it whole with a note
  saying "call again with `node=` instead", so **the advice arrived inside the thing it was warning
  about**. An over-long section now comes back as its **subsection index** plus its preamble, each
  title fetchable with `section='<title>'`, and `page=1..N` still reaches the raw chunks. Only
  sections 8, 9 and 10 of the AIXML reference are over the limit; no other served document is close.

**The two fixes save different things, and it is worth not confusing them.** A cache was added as
well — the embedded documents and each document's line index are now built once per process instead
of once per call — and that is where the *server-side* time went: the 18-term workload dropped from
**23.3 ms to 0.8 ms**, a single lookup from 0.841 ms to 0.039 ms. But 23 ms was never the problem.
Batching's saving is **round trips**, and a round trip is a model turn: measured in one session,
three `lvai_*` calls took 30.4 s of wall clock while LabVIEW's own share was 74 ms for the run and
under a second for validate plus convert — about **7 s per turn**, all of it latency. So the 17
turns a batch removes are worth roughly two minutes, where the server-side gain is worth
milliseconds. Optimise the number of calls, not the cost of one.

**That 7 s now has a sample instead of an anecdote, and it held.** Measured 2026-08-29 across the six
session transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/`: **2 641 tool calls over 2 549 turns, 12.90 h of model
latency against 3.63 h inside tools — a ratio of 3.6 to 1, median 7.1 s per turn.** The worst session
ran at 7.8 : 1. So the rule above is not a rule of thumb derived from three calls any more; it is the
dominant cost of every session in this repository, and the tools it points at are named with counts
in `docs/workflow-economics.md`. The largest single item there: a class unit-test run spends about
**40 calls** hand-driving a route `lvai_generate_test` already automates for plain VIs.

**The way to find the next tool is to measure a whole run and look for the step whose WALL CLOCK is
large and whose TOOL time is not.** Measured 2026-08-30 over a cold three-class build — project,
three classes, 24 accessors, five Caraya suites, 920 s end to end, 86 calls, 327 s of it inside
tools. The two halves separate cleanly and point in opposite directions:

- **The class build is LabVIEW-bound**: 151 s for the accessors, 115 s of that inside LabVIEW.
  Nothing to win there — `Save All This Library` re-checks the whole library per field, so a slice
  costs more the bigger the class gets.
- **The test build is latency-bound**: 648 s, only 196 s in tools. And the single largest item in
  the whole run was **authoring the suite runner: 186 s of wall clock against 6.1 s inside
  LabVIEW** — the model re-deriving AIXML whose shape never varies.

That is what `lvai_generate_caraya_test_runner` now does in one call, and the general lesson is the one
this file has learned twice: **a step that is cheap for LabVIEW and expensive in turns is a tool
waiting to be written.** Optimise the number of calls, not the cost of one.

**A BACKSLASH IN A `value=` ATTRIBUTE IS AN ESCAPE INTRODUCER, NOT DATA, and it must be `\5C`.**
Measured 2026-09-07 on two one-constant probes: `value="Bicycle\5CTest Bicycle.vi"` validates in
72 ms, and the same string with a raw backslash is `Error 42 … "values in the input are not escaped
correctly"`, naming the string. It is a **whole-file** refusal, so one unescaped separator loses
every VI in that AIXML. This shipped in `lvai_generate_caraya_test_runner`, which wrote a test VI's
relative path raw — invisible while tests sat in a flat folder, because the relative path is then a
bare file name, and reachable on almost every real run once the one-agent-one-output-directory rule
forced per-class subfolders. **Its unit test asserted the raw separator**, so the fixture agreed
with the defect: the third instance of "a tool tested against a plausible fixture is not tested".
A raw `:` has never been measured failing there; only the backslash is mandatory.

For scale on the LabVIEW side: `LabVIEWMCP --selftest` over a VI and its project costs 3.30 s cold
and **0.76 s warm**, whole process included. LabVIEW is not the slow part of a generation session.

**A mode attribute can change a node's output type, and setting the mode is not enough.**
`Read from Text File` with `readLines="true"` still returns a scalar string until `count` is
wired. Copy a variant that is already in the state you want.

**Always generate a VI into a project.** If it does not already belong to one, write a minimal
`.lvproj` first (§2 of `lvai_lvproj_reference`), list the VI in it, and open it with **both**
the VI pair and the project pair. This is not tidiness — it is the precondition for being able
to change the VI again afterwards.

The reason: `ConvertAIXMLToVI` cannot overwrite a path LabVIEW has loaded — `Error 1357`, "a
LabVIEW file from that path already exists in memory" — and `lvai_open_file` alone is enough to
cause it. The only thing that releases it is reaching the **IDE's** application instance,
`{LV.Application}` → `Project\3AActive Project` → `{LV.Project}` → `Application`, opening the VI
reference *there*, and writing `Front Panel Window\3AState` = `Closed`. Recipe in
`docs/vi-server-reference.md`.

**`lvai_close_vi` does that for you** — do not hand-build the helper again. This clause used to
end at the recipe, and the helper was then rebuilt from scratch in at least two sessions; one of
them left `lvai_unload_vi.vi` behind in the helpers directory, which is how the duplication was
noticed. The tool reports both preconditions below as hints when they are what failed.

That route needs the project **twice over**, and both halves were measured separately: a project
must be *active* in the IDE, or `Project\3AActive Project` returns `Error 1055`; and the VI must
be a *member* of it, opened through it. A VI opened loose while some other project is active
fails at the `State` write and stays stuck at `1357`. Hence the rule at the top: put it in a
project at generation time, not afterwards.

Do not bother with `FP.Close`, `FP.Set Close If Lonely` or `Front Panel Window\3AOpen` = `False`
from a generated helper. Those run in the **addon's** application instance, where the VI's
windows do not exist, so they report success and do nothing. `Error 1051` is the sibling of 1357
and means something else: same *filename*, different path.

**Ask which application instance you are in before believing any window measurement.** A
generated helper runs inside the AI addon's instance. It cannot see the IDE's open panels, so
`Front Panel Window\3AOpen` reads `false` for a window that is plainly on screen, and `errorCode
0` from a window operation is not evidence that a window moved.

**Validate, then verify by running.** `ValidateAIXML` is cheap and its messages name the node and
terminal. But validation passing says nothing about behaviour, and `lvai_run_vi_as_top_level`
reports `errorCode 91` whenever an output cannot be read back — *after the VI has run correctly*.
Never report success from an empty answer.

**AND VALIDATION IS NOT A SUBSET OF CONVERSION — for a class wire it is STRICTER.** Measured
2026-09-01 on one file in one minute: `lvai_validate_aixml` refused it with `Error 53` and
`the type of the source is Test Case.lvclass … the type of the sink is file path`, while
`lvai_convert_aixml_to_vi` on the same file answered **`errorCode 0`** and wrote 9 058 bytes.
`ValidateAIXML` type-checks subVI wiring; `ConvertAIXMLToVI` writes a broken diagram and lets you
repair it. That is the only known way to author an LUnit test method, whose pane must be class-typed:
author `path` stand-ins, **convert without validating**, then retype the terminals through
`{LV.Control}` `Replace`. The practical consequence is that `lvai_generate_vi` — which validates
first and stops there — cannot generate one, and reaching for it looks like the VI being impossible
rather than the gate being in the way. `docs/labview-lunit-testing.md` §3.

**Generate with `lvai_generate_vi`, not with validate-then-convert by hand.** It runs validate,
convert and the pane measurement in one call, stops at the first failure and names it, and returns
each sub-answer whole under `steps` — so nothing is hidden and a failure reads exactly as it would
from the three separate tools. The reason it exists is the pane, not the two saved turns: generation
cannot see a badly placed connector pane and neither can a run, which is how that defect shipped
twice, so `ok` is false when the pane breaches the style guide and the corrected `conIdx` values
come back ready to paste. `ok: false` with `failedAtStep: connectorPane` still means **the .vi was
written** — it is the pane that needs another pass, not the diagram. Measured 2026-08-25: 1.1 s for
the whole sequence against three round trips. `docs/bulk-operations.md`.

**When any output is not a string, run it with `lvai_run_vi_and_read_values` instead.** That is
almost every real VI: a boolean, a cluster, an array or a waveform all come back blank from the
plain call. The tool sets the inputs, runs the target and reads every control and indicator back
through VI Server, so the values arrive intact — measured on a VI whose waveform, boolean and
error cluster were all empty under the plain call and complete under this one.

**AND SINCE 2026-09-16 THE INPUT SIDE IS NO LONGER STRING-ONLY — this clause said the opposite for
weeks and the cost was not an error but a WORKAROUND.** The helper used to wire the incoming string
straight into `Ctrl Val.Set`, whose `Value` terminal is a Variant, so a string variant matched only
a STRING control; in one measured build **five separate agents each generated throwaway copies of
the VI under test with the values baked into the control defaults**, because that was the only way
to drive a VI taking a path or a number. The default helper now reads the target's panel, asks each
named control what it is (`Class Name`), and converts first. Values still go IN as text — `"42"`,
`"12.5"`, `"true"`, `"C:\data\in.csv"` — and land as the control's own type.

**The measurement that keeps it to four cases: a DBL and an I32 control BOTH answer `Digital`, and
`Ctrl Val.Set` COERCES** — an I32 control fed a DBL variant read back `42`. So there is one numeric
case, not one per representation. A control name matching nothing on the panel is `Error 1055`
from the helper's own property node, before the run — **and `errorCode` on the answer is
`RunVIAsTopLevel`'s, which reads 0 for it**, so read `helperFailed` / `helperErrorCode` instead.

**ENUM, RING, ARRAY AND CLUSTER CONTROLS ARE SETTABLE SINCE 2026-09-25 — this clause said "ARRAY AND
CLUSTER CONTROLS ARE STILL UNREACHABLE" and agents built harness VIs around it.** An enum takes an
item name or an index; a compound takes LabVIEW's own XML — the `xml` this tool returns — because
`Unflatten From XML` with a Variant as its `type` yields a variant carrying its own type. Two traps,
both measured: a name-else-number fallback turns a TYPO into item 0 (so unmatched text now goes in as
a string and `Ctrl Val.Set` refuses it, `Error 91`), and `Unflatten From XML` decodes NO character
reference, so a line break inside a string member is refused rather than sent as `&#10;`.
`lvai_set_constant` takes an array or cluster the same way, as the AIXML literal.
`docs/vi-server-reference.md`, `docs/cold-build-atm-agents-3.md`. `lvai_run_for_ms.vi`, the `runForMs` helper, has NOT had
the typed setter and is still string-only; the answer says so when inputs are passed with `runForMs`.

This clause used to say "write the result to a file and inspect that". That worked, and it cost
about eight minutes of hand-built VI Server harness per VI — measured, twice, before the harness
was productised. Use the tool; write to a file only for something it cannot reach.

**A VALUE PASSED IN MUST NOT CONTAIN A LINE BREAK.** The tool pairs control names with values *by
line*, so it refuses one outright — `errorKind: inputContainsNewline`, naming the control. That rules
out newline-separated lists as a way to hand a helper several paths, and the failure appears **only
when the helper actually runs**: the AIXML validates, the C# compiles, and the design looks right up
to the first real call. Measured 2026-08-31, after `lvai_create_class`'s new `parentInterfaces` was
built that way. Use a separator the data cannot contain — a `|` is in
`Path.GetInvalidFileNameChars()` on Windows, so no path carries one.

**EVERY VI WE CREATE CARRIES `error in` AND `error out`, AND THEY SIT ON THE BOTTOM ROW
OF THE CONNECTOR PANE.** The user's standing rule of 2026-09-12 - an instruction about all future
code, not a preference about one VI. Three parts, each a separate defect when dropped:

- **THE INPUT IS LABELLED `error in`, NOT `error in (no error)`.** The user's correction of
  2026-09-12, and it is a deliberate house deviation from NI's own default label - do not "fix" it
  back to the NI spelling. It governs the terminal WE name and nothing else: **a callee's terminal
  name in an `inputs=` string is that callee's property**, so a `Call` to a Caraya, LUnit or NI VI
  that really declares `error in (no error)` keeps writing it that way, or the wire is refused with
  `Object terminal not found for input`. Renaming those is the damaging half of an otherwise
  harmless sweep.
- **THE RULE GOVERNS A VI WE CREATE, AND DOES NOT RETROFIT AN EXISTING ONE.** The user's
  clarification of 2026-09-12, narrowing what is written above: *"diese Regel ist nur gueltig fuer
  neu erstellte VIs"*. So an EDIT does not go looking for missing error terminals and bolt them on -
  adding a terminal changes the pane, which is the caller's business, and the user did not ask for a
  sweep through code that already works. Name the gap in the report if you see it; do not close it
  unasked. The `labview-vi-editor` rule said the opposite for a few hours and was wrong.
- **THE TYPE LITERAL IS `cluster{bool.status,int32.code,string.source}`, on the CONTROL as well as
  the indicator.** Measured 2026-09-12: that exact string as a `<Control>`, wired straight into
  `Create User Event.error in`, validated, generated and ran clean. Worth stating because the rule
  was mandatory for a day with the one attribute needed to obey it written down nowhere, so a build
  had to gamble on it - the more so against this file's warning that a generated diagram cannot
  BUILD a cluster and that an error cluster has reached `Bundle By Name` as "a cluster of 0
  elements".
- **The terminals EXIST.** Not "where the contract suggests one" - always. A VI with no error
  terminals cannot be put in a caller's error chain, so the first thing anyone does with it is
  regenerate it. This retires "does it carry `error out`?" as a question to settle per VI: it is
  settled.
- **`error out` IS ONE OUTPUT CARRYING EVERY ERROR PATH IN THE DIAGRAM.** Where the diagram forks -
  two parallel loops, a case whose branches each touch a subVI, a cleanup chain beside the main one
  - join the branches with `Merge Errors` (`error in`, `error in` (252/324) -> `error out`, section 8
  of `lvai_aixml_reference`) before the terminal. The fault this prevents is a SECOND error
  indicator: `lvai_run_vi_and_read_values` then reports two clusters, the caller can only wire one,
  and an error on the unwired branch is lost in silence. **Inside a loop the chain needs a SHIFT
  REGISTER**, not an output tunnel - a `For Loop`'s tunnel indexes by default, so the chain arrives
  at `Merge Errors` as an ARRAY of clusters. `<ShiftReg>` with its `<Left>`/`<Right>` children is
  authorable and measured; the spelling is in `lvai_aixml_reference`, "Shift registers". This rule
  was mandatory for a day before that spelling was written down anywhere, and a generated VI duly
  shipped with a For Loop's `error out` unwired because its author could not find it - **a rule
  without the means to obey it produces a deliberate violation, not compliance.**
- **They are on the BOTTOM row** - `error in` bottom-left, `error out` bottom-right. That is already
  NI's style guide and what `lvai_connector_pane` checks; this rule makes it mandatory rather than
  conventional. Ask that tool for the numbers, never the table: on this station's 4833 they are
  `11` and `15`, on 4815 `8` and `0`.
- **AND BOTH ARE `connection="recommended"` - the rule said nothing about the flag for a day, and
  agents duly diverged.** Measured 2026-09-16 over one application build: of ten agent-built subVIs,
  four declared `error in` as `recommended` and six as **`optional`**, and NOTHING reported it -
  every pane passed `lvai_connector_pane` with 0 violations, and both cheap checkers were silent
  because the attribute was PRESENT and they only looked for a missing one. `required` would force
  every caller to wire the chain; `optional` hides the terminal from Context Help's simple view. The
  visible cost was the placeholder cache: `PlaceholderTools.Signature` carries the flag, so five of
  eleven sockets were cloned afresh for panes that already had one. **Both checkers enforce it now**
  - `lvai_check_aixml` answers `errorInNotRecommended` and repairs it, `scripts/aixml_lint.py`
  answers `conn-error-in-not-recommended` - and that is deliberately where the fix went rather than
  into this file alone, because **an agent's system prompt is its own definition and CLAUDE.md is
  not in it.** The same pass closed a real gap beside it: an output written `required` ON PURPOSE
  was travelling through the C# checker untouched, because it returned early on any `connection` at
  all and only ever caught the omitted case. The lint had had that one since 2026-09-15; the two
  had drifted, which is the failure this file already records for `SafeUidBase`.

**A TOP-LEVEL VI WITH NO CALLERS IS NOT AN EXCEPTION**, and that is the reasoning the rule exists to
override. `C:\temp\UserEventsFinal\User Event Producer Consumer.vi` was generated 2026-09-12 with an
`Error Out` **indicator** on the front panel, **no `error in` at all**, and **not one `conIdx` in the
whole document** - deliberately, on the grounds that a demonstration VI has nobody to call it. The
pane costs one attribute per terminal, and a VI nobody can call is a VI nobody can reuse.

**Ask `lvai_connector_pane` where the terminals go. Never assume, and do not carry a map in your
head.** `conIdx` is a *position*, and which position depends on the pane pattern. Generated VIs have
come out both 4815 (12 terminals, bottom-left is `8`) and 4833 (16 terminals, bottom-left is `11`),
and the same number means opposite edges in the two.

**Which pattern a NEW VI gets is a station setting** — `DefaultConPane` in the `LabVIEW.ini` beside
`LabVIEW.exe`, `"4833"` here against LabVIEW's factory `4815`. **That file is read-only to us: read
it, quote it, never write it**, and if something in it would have to change, say so and let the user
do it. So it is knowable in advance, and the
call with **no argument** reads it and prints the four `conIdx` values to write. Do that first, author
the AIXML with those numbers, generate — then call with `viPath` to confirm what you actually got.
For an **existing** VI only `viPath` is honest: it carries whatever pane it was given, on whatever
machine, possibly rotated.

**UNLESS THE AIXML NAMES A `conIdx` THE DEFAULT PATTERN DOES NOT HAVE - then the generator picks a
larger one by itself.** Measured 2026-09-25: five outputs need conIdx up to 19, and the VI came out
on **4834** (6x2x2x2x2x6) with no pylabview step and no project close. Author such a pane against
`lvai_connector_pane pattern=4834`. `docs/aixml-reference.md` §2.

It answers three ways: no argument for the station default plus all 36 patterns, `viPath` to measure
and review one VI, `pattern` for one pattern's map without LabVIEW. **32 of the 36 have measured
geometry** — the pattern property is read-only in VI Server, so the rest need a VI that already uses
them; the answer says which are missing instead of guessing. Re-harvest with
`scripts/lvpane_sweep.xml` plus `LabVIEWMCP --panes <sweep files>` after a LabVIEW upgrade.

Four revisions of this rule have now been wrong — "always 4815", "the highest index decides", "it
cannot be predicted", each written from a real measurement that did not generalise. The setting was
in a text file the whole time. When a behaviour looks unpredictable, check whether it is configured
before concluding that it is arbitrary.

**AND A CLASS MEMBER IS AUTHORED AGAINST 4815, NOT THE STATION DEFAULT.** `lvai_add_class_method`
and `lvai_lunit_add_test_method` both re-pane every VI they touch onto **4815**, NI's 4-2-2-4
accessor layout - so a method authored with the numbers `lvai_connector_pane` prints with NO
ARGUMENT (this station's 4833) is authored into a pane that is about to shrink. Measured 2026-09-14
on two interface methods: `error out` at conIdx 15 failed at the `conpane` step with
`pattern 4815 has no slot [15]`, after validate and convert had both passed. **The numbers for a
class member are: class wire in 11, more inputs 10/9, `error in` 8, class wire out 3, more outputs
2/1, `error out` 0.** This is a trap rather than a detail precisely because the rule above - ask the
tool, never assume - sends you to the answer that is right for a plain VI and wrong for a class one.
Ask for `pattern 4815` explicitly whenever the VI is destined for either tool - and
`lvai_add_class_method` now REFUSES a conIdx that is not a slot of the target pattern before it
converts anything, as a `panePreCheck` step naming the right numbers.
`docs/cold-build-datalogger.md` §3.

**Prefer `viPath` over `pattern`.** A pane can be rotated or flipped, so a pattern id does not pin
the orientation: 8 of the 32 turned up in two orientations across 1 449 VIs. The `pattern` answer is
the majority one and marks the ambiguity; only a measurement of the VI in hand is certain.

The failure this prevents is not subtle and it has now shipped twice: `DaqReadAndTDMS.vi` was
generated on 2026-08-13 with the set both `docs/aixml-reference.md` and the generator agent
prescribed as a constant — and landed two of its three inputs on the *output* edge with `error out`
in the *top-left* corner. Neither validation nor a run can see this; the user saw it immediately.
Beware both renders: `Print.VI To HTML` and LabVIEW's Context Help draw inputs left and outputs
right whatever the pane really says. Context Help does print the pattern id after the path, which is
the quickest tell that a pane is not the one you assumed.

**A pane is TWO numbers, and a wrong verdict usually accuses the wrong one.** The *assignment* is
which terminal sits at which `conIdx`; the *pattern* is what those numbers mean. `lvai_connector_pane`
reported five violations on `WriteWaveformsToCSV.vi` whose assignment had been cloned terminal for
terminal from a style-compliant NI VI — because the generator stamps every new VI with the station's
`DefaultConPane` (4833 here) while the assignment copied was a 4815 one, and on 4833 those same
numbers mean the opposite edges. Changing 4833 → 4815 and **moving no terminal at all** turned it
into "Nothing to change", measured 2026-08-24. So when a pane reads as wrong, ask which half is
wrong before re-indexing anything: fixing the pattern touches no `conIdx`, and therefore no caller.

**And the PATTERN half can now be repaired without LabVIEW, not only checked.**
`scripts/pylv-conpane.py` reads a pane out of a pylabview bundle, gives the same verdict and the
same corrected assignment as `lvai_connector_pane` (proven identical on two panes), and `--pattern`
writes a corrected `conId` back — moving no terminal, so no caller has to change.

**Moving terminals through the heap KILLS LabVIEW, measured twice, and the capability was removed
rather than shipped.** `--reindex` and `--follow` existed, produced files that re-extracted cleanly
and read back exactly as intended, and both times LabVIEW.exe was gone from the process table on the
first probe that loaded the result — once on a standalone VI with no caller at all, once on a subVI
whose caller had been followed. Dozens of `--pattern` changes, retargets, comment placements and
runs in between went through untouched. The cause is not established and finding it means more
crashes on a working station, so the script now *refuses* a non-identity mapping. **A genuinely
wrong assignment is fixed by regenerating from AIXML** with the `conIdx` values
`lvai_connector_pane` prints. `docs/connector-pane-repair.md` has both measurements.

**EVERY generated VI carries at least one AIXML comment; PLACING comments accurately is OPTIONAL.**
The user's rule of 2026-09-08, and it falls exactly along the cost line. A `<FreeLabel>` is free —
it rides along in the `lvai_generate_vi` call. Placing it on the node it describes costs **26–35 s
per comment**, measured by attributing every call of three builds of the same three VIs: comment
work was **35–38 % of the whole run** every time, split into 92–154 s of placing and 118–237 s of
rendering to check.

**So the mandatory comment MUST be position-independent, and that is what makes leaving it unplaced
safe.** Write it as a statement about the diagram, true wherever LabVIEW drops it — `One iteration
per element of Values` — never as a label for one node, like `Scale by 9/5`, which becomes wrong the
moment it drifts onto the `Add`. Node-specific text is precisely what needs placement, so it belongs
in the optional half; and a node-specific comment left unplaced is the one combination that
manufactures confident, wrong documentation. **Fewer and shorter wins twice**: the run that cut back
to one comment per diagram was both the fastest (570 s against 776 s) and the one that placed most
cleanly, because a small box has more positions clear of its neighbours.

**A diagram comment authored in AIXML lands somewhere the generator chooses, not on the node you
meant.** AIXML has no coordinate attribute at all, so `<FreeLabel>` can only be *created* there.
Measured 2026-08-24 on `DaqReadAndTDMS2.vi`: six comments came out at six plausible node positions
with the text-to-node mapping shifted — `TDMS-Logging einschalten` over the CSV subVI,
`Timing 100 Hz` in the top-left corner over a wire. One of the six was right, by luck. Neither
validation nor a run can see this, and a comment on the wrong node is worse than none because it
reads as documentation. Place them afterwards with `scripts/pylv-place-labels.py`; the AIXML uids
survive into the heap, so the same `--place` line can be re-run after every regeneration.
`docs/diagram-comments.md` has the traps — bounds are relative to the enclosing diagram, a control's
own caption is a `label` too, and node classes must not be enumerated.

**And the side matters: a comment ABOUT A SUBVI CALL goes BELOW the node**, because the subVI's own
label already occupies the space above it. A comment describing a stretch of diagram — anchored to a
structure or a primitive — stays above. `--side auto` is the default and decides from the target, so
anchoring a comment to what it is actually about gets the side right for free.

**AND A COMMENT FOR A LOOP OR CASE FRAME MUST BE WRITTEN INSIDE THAT ELEMENT — `uid_parent` alone
does not put it there.** Measured 2026-09-08 with a three-comment probe: `uid_parent="<loop uid>"`
on a `<FreeLabel>` nested inside the `<Structure>` lands in the loop's diagram; the *same*
attribute on a `FreeLabel` written at document top level lands on **root**, silently, through
validate, convert and a run. `placeLabels` then refuses the pair as cross-diagram and names two
uids without saying why — or, if you anchored it to a root node instead, places it happily on the
wrong part of the VI. This qualifies §2's "document order carries no meaning": true for `Node`,
`Control`, `Indicator` and `Constant`, which reached the loop correctly from top level in the same
probe, and false for `FreeLabel`. `lvai_check_aixml` does NOT catch it — the uid exists, so
nothing dangles.

**AND THE CONVERSE HOLDS FOR EVERY ELEMENT: WRITTEN INSIDE A STRUCTURE, IT LANDS INSIDE, whatever
`uid_parent` says.** Measured 2026-09-25 as a clean A/B after the fourth ATM cold build shipped an
eBad main VI this way: a seed constant nested in a While Loop with `uid_parent="root"` made the
loop a cycle, and the same constant at top level converted clean. So the nesting decides in both
directions. `lvai_check_aixml` answers `uidParentContradictsNesting` as an ERROR now, and
`lvai_generate_vi_with_events` - which never validates - runs that check before it converts;
`scripts/aixml_lint.py` had caught it as `parent-mismatch` all along, while its message claimed
LabVIEW followed `uid_parent`. `docs/cold-build-atm-agents-4.md` §2.

**But `auto` is a PREFERENCE, not a verdict, since the placer started maximising clearance.** The
preferred side is worth about 6 px of clearance in the score, so the other one wins wherever the
preferred is cramped — measured 2026-09-08, a comment anchored to two accessor calls came out
*above* them with 50 px of room. Read the side the script prints; do not predict it. The placer also
keeps every comment clear of nodes, constants, terminals and terminal captions, and off a
structure's borders. **Wires and tunnels it cannot avoid** — no tunnel uid has `<bounds>` anywhere
in the heap and wires carry no geometry — so crossing a wire is accepted.

**ON THE DEFAULT PATH, DO NOT TOUCH PYLABVIEW AT ALL — not even its read-only inspect.** Author the
`<FreeLabel>`, generate, move on; the comment sits where LabVIEW put it, which is what a
position-independent caption is written to survive. No render, no image read, no `pylv_apply`.

**An inspect you do not need is not free, because of what you then do with it.** Measured
2026-09-08: a clip check was added to that listing on the argument that it was cheap and would
"rarely fire". The next run saw `CLIPPED?` on 3 of 3 comments, placed two of them, and came in at
**588 s against the 428 s of the run before it** — 15 comment calls where that build had 9. All
three flags were then measured FALSE against the rendered diagram: LabVIEW derives a one-line box's
width from the caption at 5.1–5.3 px/char while the check assumed a pessimistic 6.0. The check is
calibrated now (it only judges MULTI-line boxes) and it is still not worth asking for on this path.
**A guard that is cheap to run is not cheap if it prompts expensive work.**

**And this whole detour is a STOPGAP.** Positioning needs pylabview only because AIXML has no
coordinate attribute; **NI is expected to extend the format so a comment carries its own position**,
and that retires the detour entirely. Do not build habits around it. **When you DO render, one call
for every VI** — `lvai_render_diagrams` takes a path per line and one build made three calls where
one would do.

**AND A COMMENT CAN STILL BE CLIPPED, WHICH NOTHING BUT THE RENDERED DIAGRAM SHOWS.** A label box
does not auto-grow, so a caption too long for it is cut off mid-sentence in silence. The placer
resizes a box that cannot hold its text — and its estimate of "cannot" was wrong in the damaging
direction until 2026-09-08: `Below the lower edge of the band the heater must switch on` shipped as
`… the heater must` in a 54 × 88 box, past validation, rebuild, export, link check and a run.
Two one-sided causes, both now pessimistic: a per-character width average cannot describe a
PROPORTIONAL font (in one 88 px box LabVIEW fitted 16 characters of `the state of the` and refused
15 of `Below the lower`), and `round` on the line budget granted a fraction of a line that does not
exist. **So finish by rendering the diagram and reading it** — `Print.VI To HTML` through
`scripts/lvdoc_print.xml`, one PNG per diagram, and **create the image directory first** or LabVIEW
answers `Error 118` without creating it. Every programmatic check in the chain passed the clipped
comment; only the picture disagreed.

**SO KEEP A DIAGRAM COMMENT UNDER ABOUT 45 CHARACTERS — that is the defence, and it is free.** The
clip came back on 2026-09-16 on a comment nobody placed: 79 characters landed in a five-line box and
shipped as `… it reports which control the user`, one word short, past `lvai_check_aixml`,
`lvai_validate_aixml`, the convert, nine subVI swaps and `execState 1`. The box is sized from the
space LabVIEW finds, not from the text, so no authoring-side arithmetic predicts it. **And there is
no cheap in-place repair** — a `<FreeLabel>`'s text cannot be edited through pylabview the way a
string constant can, so the fix is a full regeneration plus the whole swap cycle plus the icon,
which is the one thing the regeneration rule below says not to spend on a comment. The same three
comments cut to 30, 43 and 44 characters all rendered complete. This is the "fewer and shorter wins
twice" rule with a number on it.

**A BLOCK DIAGRAM STAYS AROUND 1920 x 1080, AND A REPEATED OPERATION BECOMES ONE GENERIC SUBVI.**
The user's standing rule of 2026-09-16, given three times over one build and sharpened each time.
Diagrams have been coming out too large; factor cohesive groups out rather than spreading them
across the caller.

**AND SINCE 2026-09-25 IT IS A MEASURED BUDGET, NOT A GUIDELINE - the user's correction after the
rule held only in prose.** Rendered that day, the ATM main VI of three consecutive agent builds came
out **3306, 3456 and 4152 px wide**, its state machine 2116, 2963 and 2012, and not one answer in
any of those builds said so. So the size is measured where it is made: `lvai_generate_vi` and
`lvai_generate_vi_with_events` render the result (90-460 ms) and answer `diagramSize` with the
top-level diagram in px and `withinBudget` against 1920 x 1080; `lvai_check_aixml` answers
`diagramChain` BEFORE anything is generated - the longest dependency chain in stages, budget 10,
with the elements along it. **An over-budget VI is not done**: the call still answers `ok` because
the VI is written and valid, and the agent definitions treat `withinBudget: false` as a reason to
fold and regenerate. Calibration and procedure in `docs/diagram-size.md`.

**A PRODUCER/CONSUMER THAT PASSES EVERY CHECK CAN STILL NOT WORK - found by the user 2026-09-26
on the seventh ATM build, and nothing in the toolchain saw it.** The consumer read `User Input`
as a control terminal beside its `Dequeue Element`. A terminal has no inputs, so LabVIEW reads it
when the iteration STARTS, before the dequeue returns: `Enter` verified the text from BEFORE the
user typed, and the menus never filled. Validation, `execState 1`, 58 Caraya tests - which hand
the handler its input directly - and a `runForMs` start-up snapshot were all green. Three rules
came out of it:

- **A value the consumer needs travels WITH the command**, read in the producer's event frame
  (`Enter=23456`, or a cluster element). `lvai_check_aixml` answers `controlReadBeforeWait` and
  `scripts/aixml_lint.py` `control-read-before-wait` for the shape - a WARNING, because over 739 NI
  exports it fires on 5, all a setting polled once per iteration on purpose (`Stop`, a delay).
- **An event-driven VI is verified by DRIVING an event**: `lvai_run_vi_and_read_values` with
  `runForMs` and `signalsJson`, which fires each control's Value Change through
  `Value (Signaling)` before the snapshot. A start-up snapshot proves start-up. A LATCHED boolean
  cannot be signalled (`Error 1193`), so what it triggers stays with the handler's unit test.
- **Typing counts as activity** where a spec has an inactivity timeout: register the string
  control's own `Value Change` and write `Update While Typing?` = TRUE at start-up - the catalogue
  lists it as read-only and it is writable at run time, measured through an implicit property node.

**Drive a UI VI through `signalsJson`, not through a probe of your own.** Four hand-built probes
lost their reference to the running target within 300 ms (`Error 1026`, then `1055` on its control
references), the target reading `Execution:State` 2 just before - run through the default helper and through
`lvai_run_vi_as_top_level` alike - and a copy of `lvai_run_for_ms.xml` with the signal step added
did not. The discriminator is not established. `docs/cold-build-atm-agents-7.md`.

**A GENERATED TEST VI HAS THE SAME BUDGET - measured 2026-09-26, when the sixth ATM build's
thirteen-case method test came out 4345 x 4084 px with every answer green.** The test generators had
been exempted as "internal"; they measure their test VI now and answer `diagramSize`. About 310 px
of height per case, so plan about THREE cases per test VI and list them all in one runner. And
`lvai_generate_vi` measures on `failedAtStep: execState` too, which is the ROUTINE outcome for a class
method or a caller whose class seed is still a path - it returned before the size step there, so the
VIs the budget matters most for came back unmeasured.

**The worked example is the one to copy.** Six `Property Node`s writing `Disabled`, one per
front-panel object, chained across the middle of a loop, became one call taking a group of controls
and one boolean. The user's correction when the first version filtered the whole panel by label
INSIDE that VI is the part that matters: **a helper that repeats one operation takes an ARRAY and
knows nothing about the application it serves**, or it gets rewritten instead of reused. `Set
Controls Disabled.vi` is the shape - references plus names plus one boolean, no ATM in it anywhere.

**THE CALLER READS ITS OWN PANEL WITH TWO PROPERTY NODES AND AN UNWIRED `reference`.**
`{LV.VI}` `read+Front Panel` -> `{LV.Panel}` `read+Controls[]`, and the `reference` input of the
first is left EMPTY, which means *the VI it sits on*. That is the only way a generated VI gets its
own control references, and NI's own exports carry the shape. `array{ref{LV.Control}}` and
`ref{LV.Control}` are valid AIXML type literals.

**A BOUND CONTROL REFERENCE CANNOT BE AUTHORED, so the group travels as an array of NAMES.** Measured
twice: `link` is not declared for `<Constant>` (the schema is closed), and an implicitly linked
property node has NO `reference out` terminal. The user approved names as the workaround. Keep the
lookup in its own generic VI - `Get Controls By Label.vi` - rather than welding it into the worker,
and say in the caller's documentation that RENAMING A CONTROL SILENTLY DROPS IT OUT OF ITS GROUP,
because nothing checks the list against the panel. `docs/control-reference-binding.md` has the heap
structure for the day the creation route is settled.

**WIDTH FOLLOWS THE LONGEST DEPENDENCY CHAIN; HEIGHT FOLLOWS WHAT SITS IN PARALLEL.** Measured over
three rounds on one main VI: pulling ten parallel nodes into subVIs took the height from 1094 to
880 px and moved the width by 23 px. Then replacing ONE call with two sequential ones put 131 px of
width straight back. So **factoring parallel work buys height**, and width only comes down by making
the chain SHORTER. **That is done by folding a SEQUENTIAL stretch of the chain into ONE new subVI** -
one call where four stages were. This paragraph used to call that "merging sequential subVIs back
together - the opposite of the rule", and it is not the opposite: it is the same rule one level up,
a hierarchy instead of a flat caller. The chain is also calibrated now: one stage renders about
145-185 px on the big diagrams (25 stages 4152 px, 12 stages 2012), so 1920 px is 11-12 stages.
AIXML carries no coordinates, so a long pipeline cannot be wrapped onto a second row - only
shortened. `docs/cold-build-atm-cld.md` section 11, `docs/diagram-size.md`.

**AND A REGENERATION COSTS THE WHOLE SWAP CYCLE, so do not regenerate for a comment.** Rewriting a
generated subVI from AIXML puts its placeholder sockets back and destroys its icon - measured on a
description-only change, which cost `Error 1357`, two `lvai_swap_subvis` calls and an icon reset for
one sentence. Batch documentation changes into a regeneration you are making anyway.

**Everything you write INTO a VI is English by default — descriptions, terminal descriptions and
diagram comments alike. A German request does not imply German text.** Only an explicit wish
("auf Deutsch", "in French") changes it, and then everything in that VI follows it.

This rule already existed and was still broken, which is the part worth keeping: every
`.claude/agents/labview-*.md` states it, and working *directly* — as this session did, because the
Agent tool was not to be used — never reads them. A rule that lives only in an agent definition is
invisible to the route that does not spawn an agent, the same failure mode as a document that is
embedded but never served. Twelve German comments and sixteen German descriptions shipped before the
user asked for English. Control NAMES are a different question: they are the VI's public interface,
so they stay as the caller specified them.

**VALIDATION ACCEPTS THREE FAULTS, and one of them silently changes the diagram.** Measured
2026-09-03 by running one small VI per case: of nine checks an author would assume `ValidateAIXML`
makes, six it makes and three it does not. A **`uid_parent` naming no element** is the damaging
one - LabVIEW places that element on the TOP-LEVEL diagram and reports nothing, so a node meant to
sit inside a For Loop ends up outside it, through validate, convert and a run alike; only a
re-export shows it. A **duplicate `uid`** is silently renumbered, so the export stops matching your
file. A **Ring `value` outside its `values`** passes with `errorCode 0`.

**Two more joined the list on 2026-09-04, both about an enum, both measured on one probe VI.** An
enum `value` that is a **LABEL** (`value="open or create"`) is DISCARDED and written as `0`; an
index **past the last item** is CLAMPED (9 became 4 on a five-item enum). Both answered
`errorCode 0`. The field cost was a `TDMS Open` running as `open` instead of `open or create`,
whose symptom was `Error 7, file not found` - pointing at the path, not the enum. `lvai_check_aixml`
repairs the label case to its index and reports the overshoot without touching it.

**AND A SIXTH, measured 2026-09-14: a non-empty `timestamp` `value` is DISCARDED.** One probe, `type="timestamp" value="3800000000"` on a control and an indicator: the
lint answered `[clean]`, `ConvertAIXMLToVI` answered `errorCode 0` and wrote 4 119 bytes, and the
export read back `value=""` on both. **The damage is not a broken VI - it is a GREEN TEST THAT PINS
NOTHING.** A generated round-trip test authors the written value and the Expected constant in the
same document, so BOTH are discarded, and the assertion then compares empty with empty and passes.
Measured on a real LUnit suite with a control in the same run: the `string` field kept `PT-101` on
both sides, the `timestamp` field came back empty on both. So **a `timestamp` field cannot be
round-trip tested through AIXML-authored constants at all** - test it through a route that sets the
value at run time, or leave it out of the generated suite and say so.

**BOTH CHEAP CHECKERS SEE IT SINCE 2026-09-15** - `lvai_check_aixml` answers `timestampValueDiscarded`
and `scripts/aixml_lint.py` answers `timestamp-value-discarded`, both WARNINGS because LabVIEW accepts
the document. **Deliberately NOT repaired**, unlike every other finding in that checker: there is no
non-empty timestamp literal to correct it to, and emptying the value silently would manufacture the
vacuous test the warning exists to prevent. **And the scope was MEASURED before it was written** - one
probe carrying six constants, converted and exported back: `string`, `path`, `double`, `int32` and
`bool` all KEPT their literal, `timestamp` alone came back empty. The previous day's
`indicatorWithoutValue` had already been scoped too narrowly once by reasoning from a family rather
than from a probe, so "widen it to the types that look similar" was the move not made.
**`lvai_lunit_scaffold_class_tests` also stops writing the test**: a `timestamp` field gets no round
trip and is named under `roundTripsSkipped`. It skips one FILE rather than refusing the call, and the
reason is what each test CLAIMS. A round trip claims `the Write stored it and the Read returned it` -
which a Write that stores nothing satisfies at the default, so there is nothing left. The defaults
test claims the field reads its DEFAULT, which is exactly what a discarded literal leaves behind. The
independence test claims **no OTHER `Write` disturbed this field**, and that is still caught - so it
keeps the field, authors the DEFAULT on both sides instead of the caller's value, and says so in the
assertion's own description. **The first version of this fix left that file alone and called it
honest, and the new lint check promptly flagged two constants in it** - the generated file is the
place a checker earns its keep. `docs/cold-build-alarmgate.md` §3.

`lvai_check_aixml` catches all of these without LabVIEW, `lvai_generate_vi` blocks on the dangling
parent and repairs the rest, and the two raw RPCs report them as `preCheck`. It does NOT check terminal names, types, wiring or cycles - LabVIEW does those well
and a second implementation would drift.

**And `uid="0"` is a SENTINEL, not a number.** The schema's minimum is 0 (a negative uid is refused,
`minInclusive facet value '0'`), it may be REUSED within one file, and LabVIEW assigns the element
its own id. Use it for anything no net and no `uid_parent` references. A uid LabVIEW keeps verbatim
is one above its reserved ceiling; a low one is replaced and logged. What a `uid` is NOT is a wire:
**a wire name is an arbitrary token** - `banana.value` validated and ran - and `<uid>.<terminal>` is
convention only, which is why renumbering a uid need not touch a single net.

**A `<Control>`, AN `<Indicator>` AND A `<Constant>` ALL REQUIRE `value` - and a missing one costs
the WHOLE DOCUMENT, silently as far as every cheap check is concerned.** Measured 2026-09-14 on two documents:
without `value` the converter answers `Error -2628, An error occurred while parsing the document`
and writes NOTHING; adding `value=""` / `value="0"` / `value="[false,0,]"` and changing nothing else
converts clean. The file is well-formed XML - a parser accepts it - so `-2628` means **a schema-
required attribute is missing**, not that the XML is malformed. And inside `lvai_add_class_method`
the step BEFORE it points elsewhere: the validate refusal is classified `classWireStrictness` and
converted through on purpose, so the real fault surfaces one step later wearing a parser's message.

**BOTH CHEAP CHECKERS SEE IT NOW** - `lvai_check_aixml` answers `indicatorWithoutValue` as an ERROR
and `fix: true` writes the type's own literal, `scripts/aixml_lint.py` answers `indicator-no-value`.
They were both silent when this was measured, which is what made it cost a diagnosis.

**THE CHECK WAS SCOPED TO `Indicator` FOR A DAY, AND THE SCOPE WAS WRONG.** It said so honestly -
in the failing documents every Control happened to carry a `value`, so this file recorded the
Control case as untested and told the next reader to *"widen it when someone probes it, not
before"*. Probed 2026-09-15, with a control arm because a probe that detects nothing proves
nothing, on three one-element documents differing in nothing but the attribute:

| document | result |
|---|---|
| `<Control>` with no `value` | **`Error -2628`, 0 bytes** |
| `<Constant>` with no `value` | **`Error -2628`, 0 bytes** |
| the same `<Control>` with `value="0"` | `errorCode 0`, 3 968 bytes |

So all three element kinds that carry `value` require it, and the narrow rule was letting two
thirds of the fault through. **The lesson is not that the restriction was dishonest - it was
exactly right about what had been measured.** What was missing is that nobody spent the three
minutes the probe actually costs. **When a rule documents its own untested edge, that edge is a
cheap experiment, not a permanent caveat.**

**The REPAIR stayed narrower than the check, deliberately.** `fix: true` writes the literal for a
`Control` and an `Indicator`, whose value IS a default state the type decides - and leaves a
`Constant` alone, naming it, because there the literal is the DATA. An author who omitted it may
have meant `42`, and writing `0` turns a document that refuses to convert into one that converts
and computes the wrong answer, which is strictly worse than the refusal it replaces. Same rule as
`timestampValueDiscarded`: report where the right value is unknowable, repair only where the type
already decides it. `docs/cold-build-datalogger.md` §2.

**AND THE RULE IS NOT THREE ATTRIBUTES - THE SCHEMA IS CLOSED, AND `ValidateAIXML` NAMES EVERY
BREACH WHILE `ConvertAIXMLToVI` NAMES NONE.** `docs/cold-build-shakerrig.md` §2 added `outputs` on a
`<Control>` and `inputs` on an `<Indicator>` as required even when the terminal is UNWIRED - the
spelling for that case is `outputs="value:"`, the attribute present and the net empty. Widened
2026-09-15 over eight one-element probes: `<Constant>` needs `outputs` too, and **an attribute the
schema does not DECLARE costs the whole document wherever it appears** - `foo="bar"` on an otherwise
legal `<Control>`, or `<FreeLabel text=…>` in place of `comment=`, are each `-2628` with 0 bytes
written. So a missing attribute and a misspelt one are one fault, not two.

**The practical half: every `-2628` names its own cause on the VALIDATE path.** Measured on the same
files, 5-8 ms each - `lvai_validate_aixml` returns an `Errors:` block giving the attribute, the line
and the column (`missing required attribute 'outputs'`, `attribute 'text' is not declared for
element 'FreeLabel'`), and `lvai_convert_aixml_to_vi` returns the identical error code with that
block ABSENT. A `-2628` is therefore a mystery only to whoever converted without validating - which
is a real route, because `lvai_add_class_method` converts without validating on purpose.

**BOTH CHEAP CHECKERS SEE THE MISSING ATTRIBUTE NOW, AND NEITHER LOOKS FOR AN UNDECLARED ONE.**
`lvai_check_aixml` answers `terminalWithoutNetAttribute` as an ERROR and `fix: true` writes the
spelling - the empty net where nothing reads the terminal, the real net where exactly one thing
does, and NOTHING where several do, because there the document does not decide it.
`scripts/aixml_lint.py` answers `terminal-no-net-attribute`. The undeclared half is deliberately
left to `ValidateAIXML`: catching it cheaply would need a copy of NI's attribute list per element,
and a list one entry short REFUSES A WORKING DOCUMENT - worse than the silence it replaces, and not
something to guess at when the real schema answers in 6 ms. `lvai_convert_aixml_to_vi` now says so
itself, in a `schemaHint` that appears only on `-2628`. That gap was queued after ShakerRig and the
NEXT build re-derived the rule from scratch the same afternoon, which is the argument for not
queueing this kind of thing. `docs/cold-build-conveyorrig.md` §2.

**Author AIXML by writing the file directly.** Passing it through a shell or a string literal eats
the `\3A` and `\5C` escapes, and the failure arrives disguised as an XML parse error.

**AND PUT NO XML COMMENT IN IT — A COMMENT BEFORE `<VI>` COSTS YOU THE WHOLE DIAGRAM, SILENTLY.**
Measured 2026-09-11 as a clean A/B over one document: with the leading `<?xml … ?>` declaration only
it came out **10 141 bytes**, full diagram, every event frame registered; with a leading **comment**
only, **3 168 bytes and an empty block diagram** — `errorCode 0` both times, nothing in any answer.
The declaration is harmless. A comment between children of `<VI>` is the *loud* case, `Error 42,
Generic error`, which `docs/aixml-reference.md` has wrestled with since 2026-08-13.

**That row could not find the discriminator because it was watching the wrong operation.** Its
counter-example was `scripts/aixml-skeletons/accumulate-across-a-loop.xml`, which "still validates
`errorCode 0` carrying two comments" — and converting it produced an empty 3 172-byte VI, with its
own header recording that size as proof of success. **Validation is not conversion**, and a byte
count copied from a passing run is not a test. Stripping both comments took it to a real 13 916-byte
VI. Both skeletons now keep their prose in a sibling `.md`; the cheap tell in the field is the
size, because a VI of about 3 170 bytes is empty whatever it was meant to hold.

## Which interface to reach for

**The `lvai_*` RPCs are the normal way in. The VI Server route is the exception.** A generated
helper VI driving property and invoke nodes can reach things no RPC exposes — that is how the icon
tool works, and `docs/lvai-internal-vis.tsv` maps what else is down there. Use it only when a
capability you actually need has no RPC, and say in your report which route you took and why the
official one was not enough.

The reason is shelf life, not purity. The RPCs are a contract; the back door is a measurement.
In one session it broke twice on names that turned out to be display text rather than scripting
identifiers (`Set Control Value [Variant]` is really `Ctrl Val.Set`), and an addon update can
invalidate the whole map. Before building a helper, check the table in "Where the knowledge lives"
and the tool list — several capabilities that look missing are already shipped.

**There is a THIRD interface, and for editing existing code it is the majority one.** The `pylv_*`
tools read and rewrite a VI's binary form through a bundled pylabview, with no LabVIEW running and
no Python installed. They do not replace AIXML and the dependency runs one way — every primitive
name and terminal role they annotate with was harvested by joining against AIXML exports, and
pylabview cannot author a VI from nothing. **AIXML creates and names; pylabview edits and reads.**

**Which one, decided by measurement rather than habit:**

| what you are doing | route |
|---|---|
| create a NEW VI | **AIXML only.** pylabview has no empty starting point |
| edit an EXISTING VI | **call `pylv_route` first.** It answers `route` + `routeReason` with the evidence |
| read a VI when the gRPC service is up | AIXML — 37× smaller, so it costs less context |
| read a VI with no LabVIEW, no licence, in CI | pylabview — the only route |
| a `.ctl`, an icon, layout, decorations | pylabview. NI's list puts `.ctl` outside the generator entirely |
| a class, its private data, an accessor | **neither — call NI's OWN provider VIs**, see below |
| a DQMH module, or anything a vendor toolkit under `project\` scripts | **neither — VI Server BY PATH**, see below |

**THERE IS A FIFTH DOOR AND IT IS NAILED SHUT: `lvai_apply_aixml_to_vi` IS NOT CALLED. EVER —
unless the user asks for it by name, in that session.** The user's standing instruction of
2026-09-16, and it is a rule about *not spending turns*, not a claim anybody still needs to
establish: §14 of `lvai_aixml_reference` is four pages of ruled-out variables, and every one of
them cost a session. The RPC is real and surgical for NI's own assistant and gated on a per-VI
attachment bound to the CALLER, which no third-party client can obtain.

**And the refusal went SILENT, which is why this is a rule in CLAUDE.md rather than a footnote.**
Measured 2026-09-16 on one copy of one VI, two arms — closed, then open in the IDE — it answers
**`errorCode 0` with an empty `errorMessage` and changes nothing**; the AIXML export is identical
on both sides. Through 2026-09-11 it answered `Error 42`, which announced itself. So every piece
of advice of the shape "try it first, it costs one round trip" now resolves to *report a VI as
surgically patched when the file was never touched* — `.claude/agents/labview-vi-editor.md` Phase 6
said exactly that, and it has been removed rather than qualified, along with the tool from that
agent's list and from `labview-vi-generator`'s.

**The consequence for the work, which is the part that bites: AN EDIT IS A FULL REGENERATION, so a
VI whose EXISTING FRONT PANEL must survive cannot be edited at all.** Layout, decorations, custom
control styling and the icon are re-decided by LabVIEW every time. Where that panel is the point —
a customer's supplied panel, an exam template, anything with artwork — **say so and let the user
choose the route**; do not go hunting for a way in, and do not quietly regenerate and list the loss
afterwards. The only other doors are VI Server diagram scripting and a rebuild of the panel, and
both are the user's call, not yours.

**THE SCRIPTING DOOR IS MEASURED NOW, AND IT OPENS - 2026-09-30, on the Car Wash exam template.**
This paragraph said "(unmeasured here)" until then. A generated SCAFFOLD's diagram goes into a copy
of the supplied VI through `{LV.TopLevelDiagram}` `Select All` / `Copy Selection` / `Paste`; each
pasted duplicate control (`Start 2`, ...) is then swapped for the supplied one - its terminal
`Move`d into place, the duplicate deleted, the recorded `{LV.Wire}` `Terminals[]` ends reconnected
with `Connect Wire` - and `{LV.VI}` `BD.Remove Bad Wires` clears the loose ends the deletes leave,
without which the VI is eBad. Result: `execState 1`, every panel terminal feeding the sink it fed in
the scaffold, typedef bindings kept, the first state running correctly, and a front panel render
**byte-identical** to the untouched template, for about 0.6 s of LabVIEW. **`lvai_graft_diagram`
does it in one call since the same day** - accepted over raw stdio at 6.4 s end to end, `ok: true`,
with a live refusal as control - and `labview-vi-generator` / `labview-vi-editor` use it (their
Phase 6g) for a supplied VI whose diagram is EMPTY. A diagram that already holds code is refused,
so a panel over existing code still has no route. It uses the SYSTEM CLIPBOARD: the orchestrator
grafts, one at a time, never parallel agents. `docs/keep-supplied-front-panel.md`.

**GRAFT ONLY THE MAIN GUI - the user's rule of 2026-09-30.** The graft call itself costs seconds,
but the route around it - a scaffold with the panel's own labels, a project, event re-registration,
switch actions - costs minutes, and a subVI's panel carries nothing worth them. So a subVI is
regenerated like any other, unless the user asks to keep that subVI's panel. Since the same day the
graft refuses an UNWIRED scaffold terminal (`scaffoldTerminalUnwired` - it used to surface as a
`1055` misread as "no active project"), puts the plain supplied copy back on ANY failure instead of
leaving a half-graft, and sets latched buttons to Switch When Pressed itself
(`switchActionControls`, verified from the export as `switchActions`).

**There is a FOURTH interface, and it is the right one whenever the artefact is COMPILER OUTPUT.**
The IDE's own project providers live under `resource\Framework\Providers\` and are ordinary VIs, so
a generated helper can call them. Two capabilities already work this way and neither could be built
any other way: `lvai_create_accessors` drives `CLSUIP_CreateNewAccessor.vi`, and `lvai_create_class`
drives `Add Class.lvlib\3AAdd Class to Project (path).vi` plus
`Message Maker.lvlib\3AAdd Member Data to Private Data Control.vi`.

**The rule to take from it: ask whether LabVIEW COMPILES the thing before trying to write it.** A
class private data control looks like a `.ctl` with a cluster in it and is really a type space plus
a data-space layout — `VCTP`, `TM80`, a `TopLevel` map, a DCO record with byte offsets. Building it
from a converted VI produced, for weeks, classes LabVIEW *reported* and its compiler *refused*, and
no answer from the gRPC interface showed it: `lvai_describe_project` says `errorCode 0` for a class
whose private data does not compile. Only the IDE's Error list, and `Execution.State`/`BadDDO` in
the saved file, disagreed. `docs/lvclass-creation.md` §2a has the whole diagnosis.

Two practical notes, both measured: these providers need a project **open and active** — they reach
LabVIEW through `Project\3AActive Project` and answer `Error 1055` otherwise — and LabVIEW **adopts
every VI it has open** when it saves that project, so a run leaves its own helper and carrier listed
in the user's project unless they are stripped afterwards.

**AND THERE IS A FIFTH INTERFACE, for the VIs a VENDOR TOOLKIT ships under `project\`.** DQMH is the
worked example and the lesson generalises to anything installed there. Its scripting VIs —
`Script New Module.vi`, `Script New Event.vi`, `Parse Project for DQMH Modules.vi` — are ordinary
VIs with ordinary connector panes, and they build a forty-file module correctly. But **an AIXML
`Call` cannot reach them: `Error 53, Unsupported SubVI`, in every spelling.** That is not the
library-qualifier trap; a correct qualifier is not the missing piece. Generation resolves a target
by name against what the installation can **find** — `vi.lib`, `user.lib`, `instr.lib`, `LVAddons`
— and `project\Delacor\` is none of those, so no spelling exists that works.

**`instr.lib` was missing from that list until 2026-09-07, and its absence read as a much bigger
limit than it is.** Measured on `Agilent 34401.lvlib`, the one real instrument driver on this
station: `Agilent 34401.lvlib\3AInitialize.vi` resolves and answers with a **wiring** complaint
(`required input 'VISA resource name' is not wired`), which is the signature of a target LabVIEW
loaded and read the connector pane of. The bare name does not resolve, because the VI is
library-owned. So a generated VI CAN drive an instrument, and the list saying otherwise was the
only thing suggesting it could not.

**And the qualifier is FLAT — a library's own folders are not part of it.** `Initialize.vi` sits in
that library's `Public\` folder on disk and in its tree, and
`Agilent 34401.lvlib\3APublic\5CInitialize.vi` is `Unsupported SubVI` while the folderless form
works. Worth knowing before hunting for a spelling that does not exist. §9 of
`lvai_aixml_reference` has all three rows.

**`Open VI Reference` takes a PATH and has no such restriction.** So the route is VI Server: open by
path into the **IDE's** application instance (`Project\3AActive Project` → `Application`, the same
hop the class providers need), `Ctrl Val.Set` each input, `Run VI`, `Ctrl Val.Get` each output.
Measured 2026-08-31 end to end: two DQMH modules created, 30 s and 43 s, Delacor's own `error out`
`0` both times. **Values move as VARIANTS and never have to be named** — DQMH's `External Modules`
is an array of six-field clusters, and carrying it from one `Ctrl Val.Get` straight into one
`Ctrl Val.Set` means the helper never spells that type out. That trick is what makes the approach
tractable, and it applies to any refnum- or cluster-heavy vendor API.

Three things worth knowing before trying it on another toolkit. **A menu VI has no connector pane**
— DQMH's `Module\Add New DQMH Module.vi` exports 135 bytes with no terminals at all, because the
Tools-menu entry points are dialog launchers; the scriptable code sits beside them in `_DQMH *\`,
and `lvai_vi_terminals` separates the two in one call. **The source may be locked**, as all of
DQMH's is, so connector panes are the entire contract and the usual "export a VI that already calls
it and copy the shape" does not work. And **an enum-looking input may be a bare index**: DQMH's
`Module Type` is a `uint16` with no enum strings, whose meaning comes from a *runtime* catalogue
that differs per station because module types are pluggable — so read the catalogue and match by
name, never carry an index. `docs/dqmh-scripting.md` has the measurements;
`scripts/lvdqmh_new_module.xml` is the working helper.

**AN INTERFACE IS A `.lvclass`, and the same provider pattern creates one.** NI's manual defines it
as "a class without a private data control", there is no `.lvinterface`, and
`Add Interface.lvlib\3AAdd Interface to Project (path).vi` is an exact mirror of the class provider
with two differences: **no `Parent Class` terminal at all** — an interface inherits only from
interfaces — and the refnum it returns is called `Interface`. `lvai_create_interface` drives it;
`lvai_create_class`'s `parentInterfaces` wires the terminal that was hardcoded to an empty array
until 2026-08-31, which is why multiple inheritance was unreachable through the tool while LabVIEW
had always accepted it.

Three things about interfaces that cost a session each, all in `docs/lvclass-interfaces.md`:

- **The link is only settable AT CREATION TIME.** NI's after-the-fact provider is a modal dialog, and
  a modal stops the whole gRPC service. A class that should implement an interface must be *created*
  with it — the remedy for getting it wrong is delete and rebuild, before the accessors.
- **An interface link and a parent-class link are the SAME item type.** Both are
  `<Item Type="Parent">` in `Parent Libraries`, so `Ancestors` mixes them and its **order** used to
  decide what `inheritsFrom` reported. Check parents by MEMBERSHIP, never by "is it first".
  **THE ITEM CARRIES A `URL`, AND THAT SETTLES THE KIND — measured 2026-09-15, 432 of 432 on this
  station.** Open it and read its own `IsInterface`: this file said "the only way to tell them apart
  is to open each" for fifteen days and nobody did, while **46 of the 437 classes here reported a
  NON-CLASS as their parent** — NI's own `Caller A.lvclass` naming `Abstraction` where its base is
  `Actor`, `Flathead.lvclass` naming the `Lever` interface where its base is `Rotating Tool`. The
  trap that made it look closed is that **the URL is relative to the `.lvclass` ITSELF, treated as a
  directory** — a sibling is `../../Name/Name.lvclass`, and NI writes one
  `../../Serial/Serial.lvclass/Serial.lvclass` with the extension twice, because a member is
  addressed as `Serial.lvclass/Member.vi`. Against the FOLDER every relative link is not-found,
  which reads exactly like "the URL is not usable"; the first probe run concluded that. Swept after
  the fix: 449 links, 449 resolved, 400 class and 49 interface. `lvai_describe_class` now answers
  `parentLinks` with a kind each and an `inheritsFrom` that is **never an interface**;
  `lvai_create_class` adds `interfacesImplemented` read from the FILE beside `interfacesLinked`
  counted from the request. An unopenable link is still NAMED, because `LabVIEW Object` over a
  parent the file lists would hide a real one, and `parentKindsAreComplete` marks it — **that flag
  is the whole difference from the field it replaces, which was also a guess and did not say so.**
  `docs/cold-build-valverig.md` §3.
- **A class must override EVERY method its interface declares** — measured with the flag set *and*
  cleared, both `Error 1003`. So `1073741824` on an interface member is behaviour-neutral and this
  test cannot show what it means; isolating it needs an ordinary class as parent. Do not repeat the
  claim that it is the require-override flag.

**INTERFACE METHODS ARE SCRIPTABLE, and `lvai_add_class_method` is the tool** — this clause said the
opposite until 2026-09-07 and cost an agent a hand-built duplicate of a tool that already worked.
The tool does not inspect `NI.LVClass.IsInterface` and has no reason to: an interface is a
`.lvclass`, so `LVClass.Open`, `AddItemFromMemory`, `{LV.Control}` `Replace` and `SetWireRule` all
behave the same on one. Measured over five VIs on `IVehicle.lvclass` — two interface members, three
overrides, `error out = 0` at every stage, no restart.

**Copy NI's shape, which is TWO kinds of member, not one.** Measured on `Basic Interfaces`:
`Lever.lvclass:Multiply Force.vi` has `Lever in` **`dynamic`** — the contract every implementing
class must override — while `Lever.lvclass:Pry.vi` has it **`required`** and carries a `Pryable in`,
an object of a *different* interface, on the same pane. So an interface ships concrete methods too,
and a terminal on one may be typed on another class: write it as
`{"terminal":"Engine in","class":"…\Engine.lvclass"}` rather than a bare name. Both of those were
gaps in the tool until 2026-09-07 — a static member was refused outright, with a unit test passing
the whole time because it stopped at the argument parse.

**And do NOT read `NI.ClassItem.Flags` to tell dispatch from static.** Four sessions have tried.
Measured on this pair: the dynamic member reads `0`, the static one reads `1073741832`, neither
carries the static bit `0x1000000`, and LabVIEW wrote both itself. `connection=` from
`lvai_vi_terminals` is the answer — or out of a batch `lvai_convert_vis_to_aixml`, which settles a
whole class in one call for the price of the one `grep` this replaces.

**The fourth attempt was OURS, and it shipped in three documents, an agent and a code comment.**
Measured 2026-09-15: a generated interface override reads **`33554432`** (`0x2000000`) against `0`
on all sixteen accessors of the same two classes — a THIRD value, where
`.claude/agents/labview-class-generator.md` Phase 4 printed a table of two (`0` dynamic,
`16777216` static) and told the reader to grep for it. So the agent's own verification step
classified a correct dynamic override as neither, while Phase 2 of the same file said not to read
the flag at all — **a definition that contradicts itself is worse than either half.** The observed
value space is `0`, `8`, `11`, `16777216`, `33554432`, `1073741824`, `1073741832`, every one written
by LabVIEW; it is not a dispatch field at any of them. `docs/lvclass-interfaces.md` had recorded
`33554432` as "unexplained, no observed consequence" **fifteen days earlier and nothing changed** —
same shape as `dwarnCount` being halved by hand in prose while the counter kept lying. **When a
measurement contradicts a table, fix the table**, and check whether the claim also sits in code: it
did, as `DispatchFlagsOnDisk`'s comment. That one needed no behaviour change — the function returns
raw counts and asserts nothing, which is exactly right for a value nobody has decoded, and only the
comment above it drew the conclusion. `docs/cold-build-weighbridge.md` §3.

**AN INTERFACE IS FINISHED — `.lvclass` AND EVERY METHOD — BEFORE THE FIRST CLASS THAT IMPLEMENTS
IT.** Being scriptable is not the same as being schedulable anywhere, and the ordering is the
user's correction of 2026-09-07: a four-class build created the interface early and added its two
members only after the classes *and* their accessors existed. Two reasons it has to be one step.
`lvai_create_class` takes the interface list as a **creation-time** input with no scriptable way to
add a link afterwards — NI's after-the-fact provider is a modal dialog, which stops the whole gRPC
service. And **a declared method breaks every implementing class until that class's override
exists**, measured with the require-override flag both set and cleared. So the method list is part
of the contract a class is created against: finish it, then create the implementers, then write
their overrides. `.claude/agents/labview-class-generator.md` Phase 1b.
**AND THE LIBRARY MUST EXIST BEFORE THE MESSAGES - measured 2026-09-18 with a clean A/B.** Adding
an actor class to a `.lvlib` AFTER its message classes were built leaves **EVERY `Do.vi` `eBad`**:
library membership rewrites the class's qualified name to `ComputerMaus.lvlib:ComputerMaus.lvclass`,
and `Do.vi` is the VI that CALLS the actor method. **The discriminator is which half survives** -
`Do.vi` reads `execState 0` while `Send <Method>.vi`, which only enqueues, stays at `1`. Nothing else
reported it: `lvai_add_to_library` answered `ok` with `verify.items` complete, the `.lvlib` re-read
clean, and `lvai_describe_vi` showed the message's own qualified name ALREADY updated - so the relink
did reach the message class and still left the call broken. **`lvai_exec_state` was the only thing
that saw it**, exactly as that tool's own closing note warns.

**So the order is: class -> methods -> LIBRARY -> messages.** Retrofitting a library onto an actor
that already has messages means DELETING the message classes and rebuilding them - the A/B is clean,
`execState 0` before and `1` after with nothing else changed, verified twice - and loading the
hierarchy does not repair it. **Remove the library's `<Item>` entry BEFORE deleting the files**: a
`.lvlib` naming a file that is not there opens LabVIEW's modal search dialog on load, and a modal
stops the whole gRPC service. LabVIEW does swap the `.lvproj` entry from the loose class to the
library by itself, on its own save; it does NOT list a message class at all.
`docs/labview-actor-framework.md` section 16.

**AND `<VI>` REQUIRES A `description` ATTRIBUTE, which neither cheap checker knows.** Measured the
same day: `scripts/aixml_lint.py` answered `[clean]` for a document `ValidateAIXML` then refused with
`Error -2628 ... Line 2, Column 41, Message: missing required attribute 'description'`. Both checkers
cover the missing-required case for `Control`, `Indicator` and `Constant` and neither covers `VI`
itself. The validate path named it exactly, so this costs one round trip rather than a diagnosis -
which is the argument for authoring with a description rather than for widening the lint in a hurry.


**`lvai_add_class_method` VALIDATES the AIXML now, and classifies the verdict rather than skipping
it.** It converted blind because the validator is genuinely stricter for a class wire — and that
also skipped every ORDINARY wiring fault. Measured 2026-09-07: three overrides came back
`ok: true`, `terminalsRetyped: 2`, `verifiedOnDisk: true`, then answered **`Error 1003`** when run,
with the describe, the export and the `udClassDDO` count all green; the skipped validate named the
fault in 75 ms. A refusal mentioning `.lvclass`, `UDClassInst` or `LabVIEW Object` is the documented
strictness and converts anyway; anything else stops. `validateFirst: false` restores the old
behaviour, and needing it is worth reporting.

**Re-running over an existing member is safe now** (`memberAlreadyExisted`) — and getting there
needed TWO codes, not one. `AddItemFromMemory` used to send its refusal down the chain and skip
`SetWireRule` and both saves, discarding the retype while the freshly converted diagram was already
on disk: the member ended up *worse* than before the call. The first fix filtered `56002` and did
**nothing for the common case**, because a plain re-run answers **`1004`** — measured 2026-09-07,
`member already existed: 0` and all three saves still inheriting the error. So both are tolerated,
**gated on the `.lvclass` itself already listing the VI**, because `1004` is also what a full path
in the `Name` input produces and those two are opposite verdicts. The class file is plain XML, so
that check costs no LabVIEW. `docs/class-method-tooling.md` §4p.

**The process lesson is the sharper one: A FIX IS NOT VERIFIED BY THE TEST WRITTEN ALONGSIDE IT.**
The 56002-only filter passed its unit test, validated against LabVIEW, and was inert. What found it
was re-running the tool against a member that really existed — reproducing the original failure,
which is the only thing that ever settles it.

**AND "SAFE" WAS TOO STRONG — A RE-RUN DESTROYED THE CLASS, measured and then FIXED 2026-09-14.**
A green class, re-run over ONE existing member: the call answered `ok: true`, `terminalsRetyped`,
`verifiedOnDisk: true`, `memberAlreadyExisted: true`, and afterwards EVERY member was `eBad` **on
disk** — accessors the call never named included — with `privateDataBytes` grown. It survived a
full LabVIEW restart, and the method's own AIXML export was perfect throughout; the suite reported
`Broken`, not `Failed`, which is the tell that nothing ran.

**Reproduced on a minimal fixture and the obvious suspect was WRONG.** One field, two wizard
accessors, one method with no subVI calls: `5454` → one re-run → `5466` and the untouched accessor
`eBad`. A fresh class re-run with **`panePattern: 0`**, which skips the pylabview `conpane` rebuild
entirely, broke identically — so that rebuild is not the cause, and the class does not need to have
been RUN either. What is left is `AddItemFromMemory` answering `1004` for an item the class already
lists. **A flawed arm is worth remembering**: the first `panePattern: 0` run was made against an
already-broken class and showed only that `privateDataBytes` did not grow *further* — the growth
metric is not the corruption metric, and reading it as one gave the opposite conclusion for a turn.

**The tool now DROPS the class's entry first**, in the project-closed window, so a re-run takes the
first-run path — the same `dropExistingMembers` step `lvai_lunit_add_test_method` already had. It
therefore needs `projectPath`: without one the edit would be undone by LabVIEW's own save, so the
re-run is REFUSED (`memberAlreadyListedWithoutProject`), and a class file the remover declines stops
the call (`memberEntryCouldNotBeDropped`) instead of proceeding hopefully. Read `privateDataBytes`
before and after anyway — it costs no LabVIEW and nothing else in the chain reports anything.
Repair of an already-damaged class is a rebuild: `lvai_create_accessors` with an explicit
`fromField` DUPLICATES rather than repairs (NI's wizard appends a number; the tool catches that
itself and says so). `docs/cold-build-thermostat.md` §4.

The manual route stays written up in §3 of that document — `Replace` on `.lvclass`,
`AddItemFromMemory`, `SetWireRule` — with its four traps, of which the sharpest is that
**`Controls[]` returns the error clusters FIRST**, so terminals must be found by name and never by
index. **The general lesson: check the tool list before believing a `docs/` sentence about what is
missing.**

**An interface member CANNOT call the parent through `Call Parent Class Method` in AIXML.** The node
name is recognised — the validator does not say "unsupported node type" — but it exposes **no
terminals** for a VI that is not yet a class member, so every wire is refused
(`Object terminal not found for input: Car in`). Membership happens after conversion, so this is
chicken-and-egg with no way round it. An override reads what it needs through the parent's public
accessors instead. Note a *static* call to the parent's method would be wrong anyway: a dynamic
dispatch subVI dispatches on the object, so a child's wire recurses into the child's own override.

**CLOSE EVERY REFNUM A PROVIDER HANDS BACK, and treat a leak as a correctness bug rather than an
untidiness.** `Add Class to Project (path).vi` returns a `Class` reference; leaving it open kept the
new class in LabVIEW's **memory past the project close**, so the next run opened a `.lvproj` listing
that class, could not bind the item to the copy already in memory, and created a child class with
**no parent and no error**. One `Close Reference` fixed it: `parent index` went from −1 to 0, and a
two-class, twelve-accessor run that had needed **three LabVIEW restarts needed none**.

The process lesson is bigger than the bug. *"Only a restart fixes it"* was accepted as a diagnosis
for a day and written into a tool, a document and an agent — and it is not a diagnosis, it is a
description of a symptom, because a restart clears every kind of leaked state at once and therefore
identifies none of them. It also produced a model — a "stale project cache" — that a five-minute
controlled test appeared to refute, because with the project closed an edit to the `.lvproj` was
picked up on the next open. **A later cold run showed the stale copy is real after all**: a child
class came back `parent index = -1` while LabVIEW held a project containing only carrier VIs, one
of them from the previous run, so that copy had outlived a `closeProject` that reported success.
Both observations stand; what decides between them is not known. Read `parent index` rather than
trusting either. What is real, and was the grain of truth underneath, is that
`lvai_close_active_project` runs `Save` before `Close` — so an edit made while LabVIEW holds the
project open is destroyed by the close. Edit a project file only while it is closed.

**AND THE RULE IS WIDER THAN THE `.lvproj`, WITH ONE DISCRIMINATOR THAT DECIDES IT: WHO IS
WRITING.** The user's rule of 2026-09-17, and it is the general form of four separate symptoms this
file already records one at a time:

- **WE write the file directly** — `sed`, `Write`, a Python rewrite — and that covers `.lvproj`,
  `.lvclass` and `.lvlib` alike: **the project must be CLOSED.**
- **NI's own API writes it** — `{LV.Library}` `AddItem`, `Save All This Library.vi`,
  `LVClass.Open` + `Save`, the class and Message Maker providers — and the project being OPEN is
  fine. Several of those *require* it, because they reach LabVIEW through `Project\3AActive
  Project` and answer `Error 1055` without one.

So "AddItem wants the project open and a surviving `.lvproj` edit wants it shut" is not a quirk of
one tool; it is these two halves meeting. A tool that does both has to sequence them, which is what
`lvai_add_class_method`'s close-then-open prologue is for.

**Both consequences of breaking the first half are measured, and they are not the same severity.**
Three times the edit is LOST in silence — a `.lvclass` entry undone by LabVIEW's own save
(`lvai_add_class_method`), a `.lvproj` entry deleted (`lvai_generate_mock_class`'s `addToProject`),
an edit destroyed by the close above. **Once it was a CRASH**: `tidyProject` rewriting the
`.lvproj` under a live LabVIEW, *"LabVIEW does not survive having the project file changed under
it"*. So the loss case is the common one and the crash case is real, which is why this is a rule
rather than a tidiness preference.

**What is NOT established is whether LabVIEW writing its own `.lvproj` mid-call carries the same
hazard.** Measured 2026-09-17: `Save All This Library.vi`, adding `Append To Log.vi` to
`Lampe.lvlib`, wrote the `.lvproj` itself — moving that VI out of the loose item list and adopting
six strays — and LabVIEW disappeared in that call, with the log's only VI call stack naming it. No
edit of ours was involved. Treat the crash as unexplained; the point for this rule is that the
project file does get written under a live LabVIEW by LabVIEW, so "nobody writes it while it is
open" was never true.

`pylv_route` runs two checks because one is not sound: it validates the *untouched* export, and it
scans that export for node families NI publishes as unsupported. The quiet families are listed in
`docs/aixml-node-gaps.tsv` — those pass validation with `errorCode 0` and then come back **gutted**,
the container built and its configuration silently discarded, which a router trusting validation
alone would send to AIXML and destroy.

**AND NEITHER CHECK SEES A TYPEDEF, so `route: aixml` is not a clean bill of health for one.**
Measured 2026-08-28: AIXML has no way to express that a control is an instance of a `.ctl` — NI
lists them as unsupported for authoring, and the *export* drops the identity too, rendering a
typedef as the bare type it wraps. `Bounds.vi` in `vi.lib\Utility\AggHandler` carries two on its
connector pane; its export names neither the `.ctl`s nor their library, at any depth. So an AIXML
edit — which is always a full regeneration — replaces every typedef with a de-linked copy, and
`pylv_route` answers `route: aixml`, `silentlyUnsupported: []`, `validateErrorCode: 0` for exactly
that VI. Check A cannot see it because the export validates *precisely because* the typedef is
already gone; Check B cannot because a typedef is a property of a type, not a node family.

**Nothing anywhere reports this.** Same structure, same pane, callers' wires still bind, VI still
compiles. It surfaces weeks later when someone edits the `.ctl` and the change does not propagate.
So before editing a VI through AIXML, ask separately whether it uses a typedef: `pylv_extract`
answers without LabVIEW — a bound one is a `<TypeDesc Type="TypeDef">` in `VCTP` whose `<Label>`
children name the owning library and the `.ctl`, plus a front-panel heap object of class `typeDef`.
**Putting a binding back IS scriptable — but not where the control sits.** This clause read "it is an
IDE gesture" for most of 2026-08-28, on the grounds that VI Server has only `Discon Typedef` and
`Update Typedef`; that was a search for typedef-named methods, and the operation is simply called
`Replace`. Measured end to end the same day: `{LV.Control}` `Replace` with the typedef's `Path` is
**refused on a class private data control** (`Error 1073`) and **allowed on an ordinary `.ctl`**, and
`{LV.VI}` `Save.Instrument` with an **unwired path** saves a control in place — which for a private
data control means back inside the `.lvclass`. So the move is: export the cluster to a `.ctl`,
`Replace` the field there, import it back. Full wiring in `docs/vi-server-reference.md`.

**Wire the IDE's application instance into `LVClass.Open` for the import** — `Project\3AActive
Project` → `Application` → `reference` — and then **leave the project open**. That reaches the class
the project holds instead of a second copy beside it; four bindings were made with the project open
throughout. Unwired is right for the export, which only reads and needs no project at all. Both
failure modes are this one fact from opposite sides: the wired helper answers `Error 1055` with the
project closed, and a close/reopen cycle around a class rewritten through an **unwired** open killed
LabVIEW, `bad mlabel length` in `MultiLabel.cpp`. This paragraph said "run it with the project closed"
for an hour, which was the wrong lesson from that crash.

The one thing the route does NOT do: it leaves the class's **accessors carrying the bare type**. The
IDE gesture rewrites them; this does not, and a project open/close does not either. Regenerate them
when the accessor must show the typedef.

**`lvai_bind_class_fields` drives that whole chain in one call, and `lvai_describe_ctl` tells you
first whether there is anything to bind to.** Do not hand-drive the three `lvpdc_*.xml` helpers:
measured 2026-09-02, export -> bind x2 -> verify -> import cost **116 s of wall clock for 0.8 s
inside LabVIEW**, the worst ratio of that run.

**AND ASK WHETHER THE SOURCE IS A TYPEDEF AT ALL, because a bind against one that is not SUCCEEDS
AND BINDS NOTHING.** This is the trap the tools were built around. Measured on two of NI's own
controls - `vi.lib\silver_ctls\IO\DAQmx Task Name NI_Silver.ctl` and
`vi.lib\errclust.llb\Error Cluster.ctl` - both `Replace` calls answered `error out = 0`, both
installed the correct type, and neither produced a typedef link, because both files are
`TypeDefVI="0"`: NI ships them as ordinary controls. A successful bind and a bind against a
non-typedef are **indistinguishable from the calling side**. The check is three attributes in the
saved file, needs no LabVIEW, and took ~90 s of hand archaeology before there was a tool for it.

The fallback is not a defeat: the field then carries the real wrapped type - a genuine
`Refnum RefType="UsrDefndTag" Ident="Task" TypeName="NIDAQ"`, not a de-linked copy. Report it as
information.

**A CLASS FIELD CAN CARRY A DEFAULT: `double.Gain=1`** (since 2026-09-25, measured reading back
`1.0`). Before that every field defaulted to its type's empty value with no way to say otherwise,
and a sensor class shipped with `Gain = 0`. Not for a timestamp, whose literal the converter
discards. And a method test that needs SEVERAL fields set uses `seed` - `writeField` sets one and
asserts it survived. `docs/cold-build-sensor-monitor-events.md`.

**A CLASS FIELD MAY BE A `path` — and the tool refusing one was an ALLOWLIST GAP, not a format
limit.** `lvai_create_class` needs a `value` literal per type, and a type missing from that table is
refused by name; twice now that has read as "AIXML cannot express this". `timestamp` was the first,
`path` the second, fixed 2026-09-04 after a HAL class shipped with its file path as a **`string`**
and a `String To Path` in every method. A path's literal is the empty one, like a string's. **When a
tool refuses a field type, probe whether AIXML refuses it too before designing around it** — a
three-line carrier VI answers it in 165 ms. `docs/lvclass-creation.md` §0.

**A TYPEDEF `.ctl` IS CREATED WITH `lvai_create_typedef` - THROUGH VI SERVER, NO pylabview, NO
FLAG PATCH.** Measured 2026-09-25: `New VI` (Control VI), `Move` a carrier's control onto it, write
`{LV.VI}` `Control VI Type`, `Save.Instrument`. It retires the fixture route described in the next
two paragraphs, and with it `lvai_resave_ctl` and the project-closed ordering. **VI Server's enum is
ONE HIGHER than the file flag** - writing 1 saves a PLAIN control, 2 a typedef, 3 a strict one - and
every call answers `error 0` whichever you write, so the tool verifies from the saved file. **Nested
typedefs** are one `{LV.Control}` `Replace` per cluster element, in the IDE's application instance -
and **all of them in ONE open and ONE save**: two separate runs left a stray copy of the inner
typedef at the head of the `.ctl`'s type list, which only a check on `VCTP/TopLevel` saw.
`docs/cold-build-typedef-gdevcon.md`.

**AND A FLAG-PATCHED `.ctl` IS NOT FINISHED UNTIL LabVIEW HAS SAVED IT — measured 2026-09-18, and
it is a HARD STOP, not a fidelity loss.** The fixture route this repository uses for every typedef
(`lvai_generate_vi` to a `.ctl` path, then patch `<Instrument Type>` and `TypeDefVI` in the
pylabview bundle) leaves the CONNECTOR PANE of the VI it was generated from in the file. Everything
that only needs the TYPE reads straight through that — `lvai_describe_ctl` says `isTypedef: true,
bindable: true`, `Replace` installs it, `lvai_bind_class_fields` binds it, `lvai_placeholder_subvi`
flattens it — and **NI's accessor wizard answers `Error 1061`** at
`BaseAccessorScripter.lvclass:CreateControlFromReference.vi`, for that field only, on the Read side
and the Write side alike. **The tell is already in `lvai_describe_ctl`'s answer and nothing reads
it**: `wrappedType` is `Function` with 16 fields (15 of them `Void` pane slots) where a finished
control reads `TypeDef` with 1. One `{LV.VI}` `Save.Instrument` with the path UNWIRED, in the IDE's
application instance, converts it — **`lvai_resave_ctl`**, which does that and reads the file back.
**The control arm is inside the existing fixture tree**: `Outer Config.ctl` reads `TypeDef` because a
`Replace` once re-saved it, while `Inner Mode.ctl` still reads `Function` and has only ever been used
NESTED — which is why the trap survived every earlier typedef measurement. Strictness is not the
variable. **`lvai_describe_ctl` answers `needsLabviewSave` now**, which is a file read costing no
LabVIEW, and it is the check that would have saved the whole detour.
`docs/typedef-disconnect.md` §13.

**AND THAT RESAVE ONLY CONVERTS IF THE `.ctl` WAS GENERATED WITH THE PROJECT CLOSED — measured
2026-09-18 as a clean A/B, one variable.** Same AIXML, same path: **project OPEN gives 6 148 bytes
and a 17-file `pylv_extract` bundle carrying `VICD` compiled-code blocks, and `lvai_resave_ctl` then
answers `Function` → `Function` FOR EVER**; **project CLOSED gives 4 156 bytes, 11 files, no `VICD`,
and the same call converts to `TypeDef`.** LabVIEW compiled the control while the project held it,
pylabview copies `VICD` through unparsed — the very property that makes the round trip lossless — so
the flag patch lands in a file whose compiled half still says “standard VI”. **The cheap tell before
you spend anything is the FILE COUNT in the extract answer: 11 is clean, 17 means the patch will not
take.**

**AND RESTARTING LabVIEW IS A CLEAN NEGATIVE HERE.** The first hypothesis was the documented stale
in-memory copy; it is wrong. Killed, restarted, project reopened, resave re-run: `Function` before
and after, byte-identical, and a second resave byte-identical again. **The remedy is the order this
file already prescribes — close the project, then extract, edit, rebuild — and nothing heavier.**
The user's correction was explicit: *“Ein Neustart von Labview sollte nicht nötig sein. Ein
Schliessen des Projektes sollte genügen.”* Reaching for a restart first is how a five-minute A/B
becomes three calls and a LabVIEW start.

**`Error 1025, Application Reference is invalid` MEANS THE `.lvproj` IS NOT THERE.** Measured
2026-09-18 as an A/B inside one directory: `OpenProbe.lvproj` (exists) answers `errorCode 0` with
`projectBecameActive: true`, and `GibtsGarNicht.lvproj` beside it answers **1025**. A missing `.vi`
gets the honest `Error 7, File not found`; only the PROJECT path lies, and it lies by naming a
subsystem the caller never touched. `lvai_open_file` refuses a path that is not there now
(`errorKind: fileNotFound`) and names 1025 in the refusal.

**AND FORWARD SLASHES IN AN EXISTING PATH GET THE SAME `1025` - measured 2026-09-30 as an A/B on one
project.** `C:/Temp/.../Car Wash.lvproj` answered 1025, the same path with backslashes opened it.
.NET accepts both spellings, so the existence check passed and nothing before the RPC noticed; a
LabVIEW restart was spent on it before the A/B. `lvai_open_file` normalises every rooted path with
`Path.GetFullPath` now.

**IT COST TWO WRITTEN-UP DIAGNOSES BEFORE ANYONE RAN `ls`, and that is the rule worth keeping.**
The symptom was three `1025` answers for `C:\temp\ActorFW_first\Presse\Presse.lvproj`. First
diagnosis: *"the IDE's application reference has gone invalid, no cheaper remedy than restarting
LabVIEW is established"* - the observation was real (calls in the ADDON's instance worked while
anything needing the IDE's failed) and the remedy was pure inference. Second: *"LabVIEW restarted
under the session, so every reference is stale"* - and **its evidence was real too**, the Nigel
service log showing all six features dropping at 14:45:15 and LabVIEW's process `StartTime` reading
14:45:23. Both facts true, neither the cause; refuted by a fresh LabVIEW, a fresh server and a
fresh client answering `1025` again two minutes later. **There is no `Presse.lvproj`** - that actor
lives in `ActorFW_first.lvproj` one directory up, and the path had been invented, then reused
across two restarts and two documents. **Every probe was aimed at LabVIEW's state and none at the
argument.**

**So: check that the file EXISTS before concluding anything about the machine**, and when an error
names a SUBSYSTEM rather than the input, treat that as a reason to doubt the message rather than as
a lead. A restart, a service log and a process id are all *available* evidence, and reaching for
available evidence ahead of cheap evidence is how a five-second `ls` came last.

**`lvai_status` reports `labviewUpSeconds` as of the same day, and that survives the retraction on
its own merits.** The zero-DWarn note has always warned that the log is reset at start and never
said WHEN, so a zero eight seconds old printed identically to one earned over four hours - a real
gap, now closed. What is retracted is the claim that it explains `1025`. Retracted with it: that a
`1154` from `{LV.Control} Replace` is "the same fault" - that tied two symptoms together on nothing,
and the ordinary explanation (the flatten ran with NO project active, and `Replace` needs the IDE's
own application instance) was never tested against.

**AND SCOPING THAT CAVEAT TO A ZERO WAS TOO NARROW - ACCEPTANCE SHOWED IT, NOT ARGUMENT.** Measured
2026-09-18 on three freshly restarted instances, 98 s, 94 s and 91 s old: the first two answered
**`dwarnCount: 1`, not 0** - one `DestroyPlatformEvent failed with MgErr 42`, which this file
already records as benign teardown - and the third answered 0. So a fresh instance lands on EITHER
branch, and the branch beside the zero one - *"Low enough to be ordinary"* - carried the identical
defect on an instance ninety seconds old.

**The first write-up of this said the zero branch was "very nearly unreachable", from those two
samples, and the third sample refutes it** - the caveat now fires there too, verified live. The FIX
was right either way, because it covers both branches; only its justification was drawn from n=2.
Two samples that agree are not a distribution, which is the same objection this file already records
against reading 0, 1 and 2 as a trend. `StatusTools.LowDwarnNote` shares the age
caveat across both now. **The lesson is the one this file keeps relearning: a fix aimed at the case
that PROMPTED it is not aimed at the case that OCCURS** - and the thing that showed the difference
was running the tool against a real instance twice, not reasoning about the branch.


**And `lvai_open_file`'s `hint` asserted two things it had not checked, in one sentence.** It printed
*"The open itself reported no error"* beside an `errorCode` of 1025, and *"this call already tried
fronting it and opening again"* while `foregroundRetry` was `null` - the branch was keyed on
`projectBecameActive == false` alone. Both are arguments now, with a control arm so a genuinely
clean open still gets the foreground diagnosis. `activeProjectPathDiffers` learned something too:
its note said *"this has never been seen happening"*, and a FAILED open does it every time, because
the previous project is still active.

**AND A GENERATED CLASS METHOD LOSES THE TYPEDEF ON ITS OWN PANE, where the repair tool
`lvai_coercion_dots` names cannot reach.** The stub flattens correctly and the swap lands, and the
caller still reads one coercion dot — because AIXML wrote the method's own `Profil` control as a
bare cluster and `lvai_add_class_method` retypes only the CLASS terminals. `lvai_bind_typedef_constants`
finds each coerced source by its CONSTANT label; here the source is a front-panel CONTROL, so the
closing note is right for the case it was written for and silently wrong for this one. The repair is
`{LV.Control}` `Replace` aimed at the method's own pane, with the owning class saved in the SAME run
— **`lvai_bind_pane_typedef`**, after which `lvai_coercion_dots` answers `clean: true`. That note
does not assert one repair any more: it returns `repairs`, both of them, with the question that picks
between them. **Branching it automatically was NOT built, and the reason is a hazard rather than
effort** — telling the two apart means reading the coerced terminal's `Connected Wire` and then the
wire's source. This paragraph said "there is no `{LV.Wire}` in the VI Server catalogue at all", and
**that is false** - `lvai_vi_server_reference cls=LV.Wire` answers 23 methods and 27 properties,
`Terminals[]` among them, and `scripts/lvai_wire_dyn_events.xml` has read it since 2026-09-11
(corrected 2026-09-30, `docs/keep-supplied-front-panel.md`). So the stated hazard does not apply
and the branching is buildable; it simply has not been built.

**AND `Save.Instrument` ALONE DOES NOT COMMIT A `Replace` ON A PLAIN VI EITHER — this file has said
it of a class MEMBER since 2026-09-02 and the limit is wider.** Measured 2026-09-18 on a throwaway VI
in no project and no class: `Replace` plus `Save.Instrument` answered `error 0` at every stage,
LabVIEW demonstrably rewrote the file (a `VICD` block appeared where the generated one had none), and
the saved file carried **zero** typedef objects — against the class member in the same session, which
carried one plus `Ofenprofil.ctl` named twice in its `VCTP`. The class `Save` is what commits it; what
commits it for a non-member is NOT established, so `lvai_bind_pane_typedef` requires the `.lvclass`
rather than pretending to offer the other case. **The only thing that saw this was reading the FILE**
— every error cluster in the chain was zero — which is why that tool gates `ok` on the `.ctl` name
appearing in the saved VI's own type descriptors and never on the helper's own count.

**AND THE FILE CHECK ALONE WAS A FALSE PASS, found on ACCEPTANCE the next session.** Asked to bind a
terminal named `Gibtsnicht` onto a VI whose `Profil` was ALREADY bound to that `.ctl`, the tool
answered **`ok: true`, `verified: true`, `terminalsBound: 0`, `terminalOnPanel: false`** — green for
a terminal that does not exist, with both disqualifying facts in the answer and neither gating it.
The file check asks *is this `.ctl` in the VI*, which a bind from yesterday satisfies exactly as well
as one that just happened, so it could never have caught this alone. `verified` is **three**
conditions now — the `.ctl` in the saved file, every requested terminal ON THE PANEL, and the helper
matching as many as were asked for. **The shape is one this file already records twice**:
`nodesSwapped` reporting the REQUEST rather than the outcome, and `wiringLost` trusted as a verdict.
**A field that cannot distinguish the two cases must not be the whole verdict** — and the unit tests
were green throughout, because the false pass needs a REAL already-bound file, which is a shape no
fixture had. `docs/typedef-disconnect.md` §13b-a.

**AND THE FIRST OPEN OF A VI LabVIEW HAS NEVER LOADED READS EVERY CONTROL NAME AS EMPTY.** Measured
twice on one fixture in one minute: the first run saw four nameless controls, matched none, bound
nothing and answered `error 0`; the second saw all four names and bound. Any helper that finds a
terminal BY NAME inherits this — and finding them by name is mandatory, because `Controls[]` order is
not portable. So compare what was bound against what was asked for; a zero is a reason to retry once,
not a verdict. `lvai_bind_pane_typedef` does that retry and reports it as `retriedAfterEmptyNames`.

**A CLASS METHOD IS SCRIPTABLE, and `lvai_add_class_method` does it.** This file has said in several
places that a class-typed terminal is the end of the road; that is true of AIXML and false as a
conclusion. Author the method with `path` stand-ins, **convert WITHOUT validating**, then in ONE
helper run: `Replace` the terminals by name -> `AddItemFromMemory` -> `SetWireRule(rule 4)` ->
`Save.Instrument` -> `{LV.LVClassLibrary}` `Save`. Measured 2026-09-02: four DAQmx methods built and
run that way, where doing it as separate helpers cost **~105 s of wall clock for 3.3 s inside
LabVIEW** plus 70 s more on a misdiagnosis.

Two halves of that order are each a defect if dropped. **`Save.Instrument` alone does not persist a
`Replace` on a class member** - the owning class must be saved in the same run, and a run that saved
only the VI reported success and left the file unretyped. And **`{LV.Control}` `Replace` is a silent
no-op outside the IDE's own application instance**, reporting `terminals retyped: 2` with every
error cluster zero while changing nothing.

**`Execution:State = 1` IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT A REPAIR REACHED DISK.** Four methods were reported
working on the strength of it, plus a describe answering `errorCode 0` and an AIXML export that
looked right - and all three were reading a correctly retyped **in-memory copy that had never been
written**. The only check that saw it was `pylv_extract` on the saved file: `class="udClassDDO"` once
per class-typed terminal and `class="stdPath"` at zero. That check costs **no LabVIEW time at all**,
and it is the third time this repository has been caught by a session-level reading that passes
while the file disagrees. Ask the file, not the session. `docs/class-method-tooling.md` section 1d.

**`lvai_generate_class_test` refused every non-scalar field until 2026-09-02, and the cause was one
line.** Its socket default ended `_ => "0"`, so a cluster, array or refnum field was authored as
`value="0"` against a compound type and `ValidateAIXML` answered `Error 53`. The catch-all was right
for the numeric types it was written against and silently wrong for the rest, so the call that
replaces about forty refused any class with an error cluster in it - and two suites were rebuilt by
hand at ~240 s of wall clock for 24 s of LabVIEW. The default is now recursive: a cluster's literal
is its fields' literals (`[false,0,]`), an array is `[]` at every rank, a refnum is empty, and an
enum is its numeric base. **Commas inside a `value` are structure and are never escaped.**

**ONE AGENT, ONE OUTPUT DIRECTORY.** Two agents were handed the same `Tests\` folder and overwrote
each other's suite inside two minutes; one then ran it and reported `4/4 failed` for what was only
the other's half-written file. A failure report that names the wrong culprit is worse than no report.
Give each test agent `<project>\Tests\<ClassName>\` and say in the prompt that it is theirs;
`labview-class-generator` Phase 6 and `labview-caraya-unit-test` both carry the rule now.

**AND PARALLEL AGENTS SHARE ONE LabVIEW, SO NO AGENT MAY OPEN OR CLOSE A PROJECT OR SWAP.** The
other half of the same lesson, measured 2026-09-16 over a four-agent cold build. A project is
global to the instance, and `lvai_close_active_project` SAVES LabVIEW's in-memory copy over the
`.lvproj` — the mechanism that has already deleted two class entries in one build — so one agent
closing a project silently rewrites what every other agent is writing into. `lvai_swap_subvis` is
the same hazard from the other side: it needs an ACTIVE project, because `{LV.SubVI}` `Replace` is
a silent no-op outside the IDE's own application instance.

**The protocol that works: agents GENERATE, the orchestrator SWAPS.** Say in each task prompt that
`lvai_open_file` and `lvai_close_active_project` are forbidden and that other agents are running;
have each agent author its `Call` against a placeholder, stop, and report the socket name; then do
every swap centrally in one project session afterwards. Measured on that build: four agents
produced ten subVIs in about **11 minutes of wall clock against about 32 minutes of summed agent
time**, with no project contention at all — and the swaps then cost two calls, because a socket
that appears on N nodes needs N calls whatever N is.

**AND AN EMPTY FOLDER IN A `.lvproj` IS WRITTEN SELF-CLOSING - the listing step missed that form
until 2026-09-26 and added a SECOND same-named folder, and two same-named sibling folders are
`Error 74` on open, measured as an A/B.** Twice in the eighth ATM build (`SubVIs`, then `Tests`
through a test generator). Fixed: the empty form is reused, and `lvai_open_file` refuses duplicate
sibling folders by name (`duplicateProjectFolders`). Write a minimal project with no empty folders;
the tools create one when they need it. `docs/cold-build-atm-agents-8.md`.

**AND THE ORCHESTRATOR LISTS VIs WITH `lvai_add_vis_to_project`, NEVER BY HAND.** Measured
2026-09-25 on the agent-driven ATM build: an agent's close saved the project while three helper VIs
were loaded, LabVIEW listed them at target level, and a hand-written edit then listed the same three
under `SubVIs` - so the next open answered **`Error 74`** and loaded nothing, a message about
unflattening data rather than about the project. The tool lists as a file edit with the project
closed, moves a target-level entry into the folder instead of adding a second one, and repairs any
file already listed twice; every close sweep repairs one too, and `lvai_open_file` refuses such a
project by name (`duplicateProjectEntries`). `docs/cold-build-atm-agents-pc.md` §2.

**Two roster gaps surfaced doing it, both now closed.** `labview-vi-generator` and
`labview-vi-editor` had neither `lvai_placeholder_subvi` nor `lvai_swap_subvis`, while this file
calls that pair the only route by which a generated VI calls project-local code — so an agent told
to author such a call answered `No such tool available` and **hand-built a socket VI from AIXML
instead**. It was exact and it worked, and an inexact clone is `Error 7, Bad Linkage` with nothing
in the message about panes.

**A THIRD ROSTER GAP, 2026-09-18, and this one STOPS the agent rather than costing it a detour.**
`labview-class-generator`'s description says it *"binds `.ctl` typedef fields"*, and its roster held
`pylv_extract` but not `pylv_rebuild` — so it could read a `.ctl` and not write one — nor
`lvai_resave_ctl`, `lvai_coercion_dots` or `lvai_bind_pane_typedef`. A typedef class build therefore
had to be split three ways, and an agent that tried it alone would reach `Error 1061` from the
accessor wizard in the middle of the accessor phase with nothing naming the cause. All four are in
the roster now **and Phase 2b says when to reach for them**, because a tool added to a roster with no
phase explaining it is only half the fix — the same half-measure as a document that is embedded and
never served. `docs/labview-actor-framework.md` §17a. **A capability the definition describes and the roster withholds reads
as a capability that does not exist**, which is the same shape as an embedded document nothing
serves.

**`No Error` FROM `lvai_open_file` DOES NOT MEAN A PROJECT BECAME ACTIVE.** Measured 2026-09-03:
three opens in a row answered `No Error` for a `.lvproj` that plainly exists and left no active
project, so `lvai_close_active_project` answered `Error 1055, nothing to close` after each and
`lvai_create_accessors` answered 1055 with `classPathsSeen: []`. **The cause was the foreground
window** — Chrome had focus, and the very next open took once LabVIEW was fronted. Diagnosing it
cost **270 s of wall clock for 2.9 s inside LabVIEW**, the worst row of that run, because nothing in
the chain reported the state and the tool's hint pointed at path spelling. `lvai_open_file` now reads
`Project:Active Project` back and reports `projectBecameActive`; a false there is
`errorKind: projectDidNotBecomeActive` with the cause named.

**AND LabVIEW's SAVE-ON-CLOSE CAN WRITE A STALE IN-MEMORY PROJECT OVER THE FILE.** Same run: once a
project was active, `classPathsSeen` did not list a class created ten minutes earlier, because
LabVIEW had held the `.lvproj` since before the edit — and the close then saved that copy, deleting
the class's entry from disk. This is the `classEntriesRestored` guard in `lvai_create_class` seen
from the other side. **Read the `.lvproj` after every close.**

**AND ONE TOOL LEAVING THE PROJECT OPEN IS ENOUGH TO MAKE THE NEXT ONE LOSE ITS ENTRY — no human
edit needed.** Measured 2026-09-14 on a cold build: `lvai_add_class_method` finishes with
`projectLeftOpen: true`, two `lvai_create_class` calls then wrote their entries into that same
`.lvproj` **as a file** (correctly, LabVIEW uninvolved), and the next close saved LabVIEW's older
copy over it — **both class entries gone**, and `lvai_create_accessors` answered `Error 1055` with
`classPathsSeen` listing only the one class LabVIEW still knew about. **So CLOSE THE PROJECT BEFORE
ANY `lvai_create_class` OR `lvai_create_interface`**: those two edit the `.lvproj` directly, so
nothing may be holding it. `docs/cold-build-thermostat.md` §2.

**AND THE SWEEP THAT TIDIES THE PROJECT WAS DELETING REAL DEPENDENCY ENTRIES — found and fixed
2026-09-15 while trying to add it to a THIRD call site.** `StripHelperItems` removes any
self-closing `<Item …/>` whose URL does not resolve to a file, and it resolves with
`Path.Combine(projectPath, url)`. **That arithmetic is right** — a `.lvproj` URL is relative to the
project FILE treated as a directory, verified on a real project where a class one folder down reads
`URL="../LoadCell/LoadCell.lvclass"`, the same convention as a `.lvclass` parent link. What is not a
path at all is a **LabVIEW SYMBOLIC URL**: `/&lt;vilib&gt;/Astemes/LUnit/Test Case.lvclass` is how a
project lists LUnit, and `/&lt;vilib&gt;/Utility/error.llb/…` is how it lists half of `vi.lib`.
**.NET 8 does not throw on the angle brackets** — it resolves them, `File.Exists` says false, and the
entry goes. A three-item probe built from real lines lost **3 of 3**. Live in `lvai_create_class`'s
`projectEntry` and the Caraya runner's ever since — and `FilterBench`, `ValveRig` and `KilnRig` each
carry that LUnit entry **right now**, surviving only because no sweep happened to run after it was
added. An **unreachable UNC path** is the same shape: `false` after 1.16 s, no exception,
indistinguishable from a deleted file. Both are skipped on the **angle bracket itself** rather than a
list of `vilib`/`userlib`/`instrlib` token names, because a vendor's vocabulary is not enumerable
from here and `<` is an invalid filename character anyway.

**AND THAT FIX WAS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH — verifying it against REAL projects is what showed it.** Run
read-only over six `.lvproj` files on this station, two of them production-sized, the pre-fix pass
would have deleted **783** and **2447** entries; with the symbolic guard alone, still **454** and
**1261**. Two more forms, neither visible in a small project:

- **A URL running through a CONTAINER FILE.** LabVIEW addresses a member inside a packed library as
  if it were a directory — `ZE_BuildHelper.lvlibp/1abvi3w/vi.lib/Utility/error.llb/Clear Errors.vi`
  — and a `.lvlibp` is a **file**, as is an `.llb`, as is a `.lvclass` holding `Member.vi`. That was
  the bulk of both counts. Walk up from the resolved path: an ancestor existing as a **file** means
  the rest is inside a container and cannot be seen into; one existing as a **directory** means the
  chain is ordinary and the file really is gone, which is the case the pass exists for.
- **The ITEM KIND.** The four still going after that were a `.dll` not installed here, a second
  `.dll`, an `.exe` and a `.bat` — every one `Type="Document"`, every one a real declared
  dependency. Judge only `VI` and `LVClass`, the kinds we create, and take the kind from **LabVIEW's
  own attribute** rather than from a file extension. Both production projects then went to **0**.

**This is the fixture lesson with a number on it.** Every guard passed its synthetic test before the
real projects were tried, and all six cold-build projects were too small to disagree — the largest
had **one** entry the pass could get wrong, against 2447. **The control is the half that matters**:
a guard buys safety cheaply by making the pass inert, so the suite asserts an ordinary dangling `VI`
still goes in the same document that preserves a symbolic URL, a container path and a `Document`.

**AND THE SWEEP BELONGS ON THE CLOSE, NOT ON THE TOOL WHERE THE STRAY IS NOTICED.**
`lvai_swap_subvis` was blamed for leaving `user.lib\LV_MCP` stubs in a `.lvproj` and it never touches
the file — it has no `projectPath` at all. LabVIEW adopts every open VI when it **SAVES**, and the
save is `lvai_close_active_project`'s first step, so that is where the entries appear and the only
place a sweep can see them. It now takes an optional `projectPath` and reports `projectSweep` with
the names it removed — and `swept: false` plus the reason when it was given no path, because a step
that is silent when skipped is one the reader assumes ran. **What it cannot reach it says outright**:
a VI adopted from a directory OUTSIDE every one of our trees stays, since nothing distinguishes it
from one the user shares from a sibling folder on purpose, and a rule wide enough to catch it would
delete those. **The one exception is the user's `%TEMP%`, since 2026-09-26**: a VI there is swept
even while its file exists, unless the project itself lives under `%TEMP%` - the sixth ATM build's
close-save listed four probe VIs from the session scratchpad, which is under `%TEMP%` and none of
our named trees, and no real project keeps code in a temp directory. Same distinction as the `[Executing: …]` tag on a DWarn — **the step where damage is
noticed is not the step that caused it.** `docs/cold-build-weighbridge.md` §3a, §4, §8.

**"THE CLOSE IS THE ONLY PLACE A SWEEP CAN SEE THEM" IS TOO NARROW - `Save All This Library.vi`
WRITES THE `.lvproj` TOO, measured 2026-09-17.** One `lvai_add_to_library` call put
`Append To Log.vi` into `Lampe.lvlib`; LabVIEW then **died in that call** and no close ever ran -
and the `.lvproj` on disk had nevertheless been rewritten, with the VI's loose `<Item>` line gone
(correctly - it belongs through the library now) and **six strays adopted in**: our own
`lvai_add_one_to_library.vi` out of the helpers directory, and five `/<userlib>/LV_MCP` sockets from
the swap two sessions earlier. So the save that adopts is not only the close's; any NI call that
saves a library can do it, and strays can be on disk with no close in the session at all. The sweep
is still right to live on the close - that is where it can run safely - but a caller who reasons
"no close, so the project file is untouched" is wrong, and that reasoning is what sent the first
reading of this crash looking for a hand edit that had never happened.

**AND `lvai_generate_mock_class`'s `addToProject` IS THE SAME HAZARD FROM A THIRD SIDE - measured
2026-09-15.** A mock generated with `addToProject: true` against an open, ACTIVE project writes all
four of its files and then appears in the `.lvproj` **not at all**: the next close SAVES LabVIEW's
in-memory copy over the file, and the mock is not in that copy. The tell that settles it is that the
same save ALSO deleted an entry for an earlier mock that had been written into the file BY HAND - so
nothing removed an entry, the whole file was replaced. `ok: true` and four `filesOnDisk` throughout,
and a `strayVisRemoved: 5` from the NEXT tool sent the first diagnosis after the wrong step
entirely. **Pass `projectPath` instead**: the entry is then written as a file edit with LabVIEW
uninvolved, after closing the project - the same route `lvai_create_class` uses, and the two are
mutually exclusive because LMock's terminal needs the project OPEN and a surviving edit needs it
CLOSED. Verified as an A/B: written while LabVIEW holds the project it is deleted, written with the
project closed it survives the next open and save, and it has now survived three such cycles.
**The tool SAYS SO in the answer too** - `addToProject: true` without a `projectPath` comes back as
`projectEntry: {action: "notWritten", warning: ...}`, because a warning that lives only in a
description is read after the entry has already gone. **And `strayVisRemoved` names what it removed
now**: that bare count is what sent this diagnosis after the wrong step, and a number cannot be
checked against a hypothesis where a list can. `docs/cold-build-samplebench.md` §3.

**`projectDidNotBecomeActive` IS AUTOMATABLE, and `lvai_open_file` NOW DOES IT.** The cause is
LabVIEW not having the foreground, and this file called the remedy a human action ("bring its
window to the front") until 2026-09-14 — which stops an unattended run dead. It is two Win32 calls:
`ShowWindow(SW_RESTORE)` then `SetForegroundWindow` on LabVIEW's `MainWindowHandle`. The tool tries
it as a RETRY once the cheap read has already said the open did not take, and reports
`foregroundRetry` saying whether it ran and whether it helped; `Infra/LabViewWindow.cs` has it, and
`docs/cold-build-thermostat.md` §3 has the PowerShell equivalent for a shell of your own. Fronting
a window is visible to whoever is at the machine, which is why it is a retry and not a
precondition.

**A GENERATED METHOD CANNOT READ ITS OWN FIELDS THROUGH AN AIXML `Call`** — `Error 53, Unsupported
SubVI: AnalogInput.lvclass:Read Physical Channel.vi`, measured — **with the class NOT loaded.**
Measured 2026-09-25: once one member of the class is open, `ConvertAIXMLToVI` resolves
`X.lvclass\3AAccessor.vi` for a caller OUTSIDE the class. A method of the SAME class authored that
way is not measured, and `lvai_add_class_method` converts with the project CLOSED — the state in
which the call does not resolve — while its validate classifier (`IsClassTypeComplaint`, any
message containing `.lvclass`) would wave the `Unsupported SubVI: X.lvclass:…` refusal through as
class-wire strictness. `docs/aixml-call-loaded-vi.md` §4. So a generated method either takes
its parameters on the connector pane, or reaches its accessors through `lvai_placeholder_subvi` plus
`lvai_swap_subvis`, **and that route works for accessors — this clause said it collapsed and that was
wrong.** Written 2026-09-03 from an agent's reasoning rather than a measurement, it claimed
placeholders cached "by signature" would give `Minimum Value`, `Maximum Value`, `Timeout` and an
inherited `Sample Rate` — all class + double — one indistinguishable socket. Measured the same day:
`PlaceholderTools.Signature` puts the terminal NAME in the hash
(`o:Minimum Value:double:2:recommended`), so those four produced four distinct stubs, and nine
accessors produced nine. **Field names are unique within a class by construction, so accessor sockets
cannot collide.** The collapse is real only for panes that are identical NAME INCLUDED — two methods
with the same terminal names, not two fields with the same type.

So a generated method CAN read its own fields, and a real HAL is reachable: measured over four DAQmx
methods that take only the class wire and the error cluster, `socketsLeft: 0` on all four. Choose the
signature deliberately and say which — but never report that a method stores a value in the object
when it returns it on a terminal instead.

**AND ONE DIAGRAM MAY CALL THE SAME METHOD SEVERAL TIMES — it costs one swap call per node.** The
uniqueness rule is on **`swapsJson`**, not on the diagram: two ENTRIES naming one socket cannot say
which node gets which target, so they are refused (`badArguments`, naming the socket and the count).
Two NODES are not. Measured 2026-09-15 on a two-call probe: one swap call answers `ok: false` with
**`socketsLeft: 1`** and `nodesSwapped: 1`, the SAME call again answers `ok: true`, `socketsLeft: 0`
and names the target, and the result runs — `execState 1` with a class constant feeding the chain.
**IT COSTS ONE CALL PER NODE WHATEVER N IS** - measured to three on 2026-09-15 - but
`socketsLeft` is NOT that counter - it counts how many `swapsJson` ENTRIES still occur in
the export, so with one repeated socket it reads 1 until the last node goes and then 0.
Measured at N=3 on 2026-09-15: after swaps 1, 2 and 3 it answered 1, 1, 0 while two, one
and zero nodes were left. The two-call probe could not see that - at N=2 a count and a flag
are the same numbers. **`diagramSubVis` is the per-node view**, because it lists the
diagram's subVI names WITH REPETITION. `docs/cold-build-kilnrig.md` §2.

Worth stating because **both texts said the opposite**. `lvai_swap_subvis`' own description read
"EVERY SOCKET NAME MUST BE UNIQUE on the diagram", and `docs/cold-build-valverig.md` §4 copied that
into "A GENERATED VI CANNOT CALL THE SAME CLASS METHOD TWICE" — an impossibility claim written in
the same voice as the measurements around it, which is the shape `docs/tool-argument-errors.md`
records as costing eighteen days. Both are corrected, and both now say what they used to claim.
**When a description explains a MECHANISM, probe the mechanism** — this one cost four minutes.

**A CALL INSIDE A LOOP OR A CASE FRAME WAS INVISIBLE TO THE SWAP, and that is FIXED as of
2026-09-16.** The helper collected its candidates from `{LV.Diagram}` `SubVIs[]`, which lists the
nodes of the diagram it is ASKED ABOUT and does not descend into structures — so a nested call came
back under `socketsNotOnDiagram`, a field whose own text says the name is not on the diagram while
the node was plainly there — and `diagramSubVis`, which that field's hint sends you to, has the same
blind spot, so the listing agrees that the name is absent. Measured on a VI with five calls, three
on the top-level diagram and two inside a Case frame: the three were listed, the two were not.
Verified after the fix on a generated main VI whose six calls all sit inside its event loop, two of
them additionally inside Case frames — all six listed, five of five entries swapped in ONE call.
`Traverse for GObjects.vi`
(`VI Scripting - Traverse.lvlib\3ATraverse for GObjects.vi`, `Class Name` = `SubVI`,
`Traverse Target` = 1 for the block diagram) walks the whole diagram; it hands back GObject
references, so each needs `To More Specific Class` onto `ref{LV.SubVI}` before `VI Name` is read or
`Replace` is invoked.

**THE PYLABVIEW FALLBACK IS NOT AN ANSWER FOR THIS, and it fails LOUDLY only on the second look.**
`pylv_apply {"op":"retarget"}` reaches a nested node — it edits link records and never walks a
diagram — and on the same VI it produced `callTargets` naming all five real subVIs, a clean AIXML
export, and a VI LabVIEW then refused to load: `execState 0`, `Missing subVI <name> in VI <caller>`.
Measured twice, once on a caller sitting in the SAME folder as its targets, so the usual
"LabVIEW searches beside the caller" does not rescue it. **Generation is `lvai_swap_subvis`; the
retarget op is for a pane-compatible swap of something already linked.**

**AND A TOP-LEVEL UI VI MUST NEVER BE RUN THROUGH THE UNTIMED HELPER — it blocks the whole gRPC
service, not just the call.** `lvai_run_and_read.vi` wires `Wait until done` = TRUE, so a VI that
never ends is waited on for ever, and because the service is what runs the helper every later
`lvai_*` call answers `DeadlineExceeded` until LabVIEW is killed. `runForMs` exists precisely for
that VI and selects `lvai_run_for_ms.vi` instead — but the selection was
`helperAixmlPath ?? default`, so **a client that sends every declared parameter defeated it on
every call** and the feature was unreachable from one. Fixed 2026-09-16: a `helperAixmlPath` with
no `run for ms` control is corrected rather than obeyed, and the answer says so in
`helperOverridden`. Diagnosing it cost two LabVIEW restarts. The general shape is the one
`docs/tool-argument-errors.md` already records — **a parameter that one mode ignores must not be
able to defeat that mode.**

**A SWAP CAN LOSE A WIRE WITHOUT LOSING A LINK, and `lvai_swap_subvis` used to call that a clean
restore.** Measured 2026-09-03: retargeting one accessor onto another whose pane differs in TYPE
left the value wire attached to the CLASS terminal - both are refnums, so LabVIEW's `Replace`
re-attached it there - and `Sample Rate:` came out unwired. The diagram linked, compiled, ran and
asserted against the wrong terminal, so the suite went GREEN. `verify` saw nothing because it
compared call TARGETS only. It now compares wiring too: `wiringChecked` says the check ran,
`wiringLost` names any node that came out with fewer wired nets, and `ok` is false when that list
is not empty. One extra export, 140 ms, an RPC rather than a model turn.

**AND THAT CHECK MAY NOT DECIDE ANYTHING - retracted 2026-09-04 after three false negatives.**
`wiringLost` gated `ok` for one day and was wrong every time it fired in production. Two reasons,
each fatal on its own: a **uid is not stable across `Replace`** when several nodes move (five Write
nodes measured jumping to 1070/273/269/230/124, so a before/after pairing by uid compares unrelated
nodes - one finding named `LVMCP ClsW5.vi` before and `Read Error Cluster.vi` after), and **a drop
in wired terminals is the intended shape**, because a real accessor's error terminals are fed a
fresh `no error` constant where the socket's were chained. No counting scheme separates the defect
from the tool's own output. `ok: false` also suppressed the caller's `projectEntry` step, costing
two agents ~135 s each on a correct diagram. It is REPORTING ONLY now; `callTargets` and
`socketsLeft` are the verdict. `docs/class-method-tooling.md` section 4m and its retraction.

**AND A SWAP'S `nodesSwapped` WAS THE REQUEST, NOT THE OUTCOME — three occurrences of one defect,
fixed 2026-09-15.** It was `swaps.Count`, so it could never disagree with the caller, and the
answer then contradicted itself exactly where a caller needs it: `nodesSwapped: 8` beside a
`socketsNotOnDiagram` listing five of those eight, with the helper errored and the file correctly
not saved. **`docs/class-method-tooling.md` D1 measured that at ~100 s of wall clock for ~3 s of
LabVIEW and WROTE THE REMEDY DOWN** — *"`socketsNotOnDiagram` should not be populated when
`nodesSwapped > 0`"* — and nothing changed for twelve days, so the identical contradiction turned
up in a cold build as `nodesSwapped: 1` for a swap that matched nothing, and was written up there
as a NEW finding. **A remedy recorded as a recommendation is not a fix; it is a note for someone
who will not read it.** Same shape as `dwarnCount` being halved by hand in prose while the counter
kept lying — *fix the thing that produces the number*.

The rule now: **an errored helper landed NOTHING**, because a `Replace` that fails leaves its error
on the wire and that stops `Save.Instrument`, so the file on disk is untouched whatever happened in
memory; otherwise the count is the sockets the helper actually FOUND. `nodesAsked` keeps the
request visible beside it.

**TWO MORE THINGS THE SAME ANSWER NOW CARRIES, both of which had been re-derived by hand.** A node
**already pointed at a class member carries its QUALIFIED name** — a second swap over one diagram
must say `Centrifugal Pump.lvclass:Read Last Event.vi`, and the bare name matches nothing, measured
twice before anyone wrote it into the tool. And **`diagramSubVis` lists what the diagram actually
has**: the helper has reported those names all along as `node names found`, reachable only inside
the swap step's sub-answer — which the default `verbose: false` STRIPS — while the note told the
reader to take names from it. **The advice arrived inside the thing it was warning about**, the same
shape `lvai_aixml_reference` section 8 was caught by. Finally, **`Error 1055` is
`errorKind: noActiveProject`** rather than a bare number beside an Invoke Node's name, because
`{LV.SubVI}` `Replace` is a silent no-op outside the IDE's own application instance — and
**`lvai_run_lunit_tests` leaves NO active project**, so a swap issued straight after a test run
lands there every time. `docs/cold-build-pumpstand.md` §4.

**AN INTERFACE'S OVERRIDES BELONG IN THE SAME STRETCH OF WORK AS THE CLASS'S OTHER METHODS, and
only ONE check sees it when they do not.** Measured 2026-09-15 on a cold build: a class implementing
an interface whose override had not been written yet had `Add Sample.vi` answer **`execState 0`,
eBad, "VI has an error of type 8"** - while `lvai_add_class_method` said `ok: true`,
`terminalsRetyped: 2`, `verifiedOnDisk: true`, `lvai_swap_subvis` said `socketsLeft: 0` with all
four `callTargets` correct, and the lint was clean. **A missing override breaks EVERY member of the
class**, not the method you are looking at, so the broken VI does not name the cause. The A/B is
clean - the same VI went 0 to 1 the moment the override landed and nothing else changed. The file-
level checks are all right about what they check; **`lvai_exec_state` is the only cheap thing that
answers the question they do not ask.** `docs/cold-build-filterbench.md` §2.

**AND A CARAYA FAILURE NAMES THE CASE AND NOTHING ELSE - a real difference from LUnit, measured
2026-09-15.** Caraya's JUnit report writes the literal string `"FAIL"` as the failure body, where
LUnit's `Pass If Equal.vim` writes `Expected:… / Actual:…` into the same place - which is why
`lvai_run_lunit_tests` can promise "there is nothing to look up" and nothing equivalent can be
promised for Caraya. Not a defect in either tool; a property of the frameworks' own reports, and
worth weighing when the framework is still open, because **a Caraya failure costs a diagnosis that
the same failure under LUnit does not.** The runner's `error out` answers **7002** for a failed
suite and `0` for a green one, which is the documented pass/fail signal rather than a fault.

**A TOOL TESTED AGAINST A PLAUSIBLE FIXTURE IS NOT TESTED.** Both tools that failed on their first
real use, 2026-09-03, failed this way and nothing else. `lvai_bind_class_fields` read
`VCTP/TopLevel` index 1 as the field cluster, which is right for an EXPORTED `.ctl` and one level too
high for the class private data control it exists for — index 1 there is a `TypeDef` wrapper holding
the cluster labelled `Cluster of class private data`. Its unit tests passed because they were written
against the exported shape. `lvai_generate_method_test` left the method's `required` inputs unwired
and answered `ok: true` for a suite Caraya refused with `7101, not in an executable state`, because
AIXML enforces `required` against what the CALLEE declares and the socket declared no such terminal.
**Build the fixture by unwrapping the real artefact** — `docs/class-method-tooling.md` §4b has both,
including why the descent must be through `TypeDef` and not through "a single cluster child".

Pylabview cannot compose a typedef heap object where none exists; and re-pointing one that ALREADY
exists is **not** the cheap label substitution it looks like — measured 2026-08-28, the typedef's file
name sits 12 times in `VCTP` and 3 more in `VITS`, a block pylabview cannot parse and copies through
unchanged. Untested either way; do not promise it — and with `Replace` available there is now little
reason to try.
`docs/aixml-reference.md` §5 and `docs/lvclass-creation.md` §3 have the measurements.

**This clause used to name `Event Structure` and `Timed Loop` as those quiet cases, and both are
loud.** `Timed Loop` returns `errorCode 1`, `Unsupported node type: Timed Loop`, by name.
`Event Structure` returns `errorCode 1` too — re-measured 2026-08-22 on `State Machine
Fundamentals.vi`, `Event Data Node: Cluster is invalid or empty` plus `Event Structure: One or more
event cases have no events defined.` For `Event Structure` the export is faithful, `CaseFrame`s and
event specifiers included; it is the generator that cannot read one back. **But "cannot read one
back" is too strong, corrected 2026-09-10.** `ConvertAIXMLToVI` KEEPS every frame and
everything inside it - `diagramList`, `dataNodeList` and `filterNodeList` all hold their
count - and collapses only `EventNodeEvents` to a single Timeout spec. So an event structure
survives an AIXML edit and only its REGISTRATION has to be written back, one
`pylv-set-event-spec.py` call per frame. That makes a VI with a front-panel event structure
fully editable through AIXML, which this file has said twice that it is not. **A NEW
frame is authorable as well** - the frame count follows the number of `CaseFrame` elements
in the document, measured by taking a three-frame export to four - so an event structure can
be EXTENDED, not merely preserved. **And it works FROM SCRATCH too** - three
frames authored in a document that was never a VI came out as three, `execState 1`, so the
generator cares only about the `CaseFrame` count and not about where the AIXML came from.
From scratch the `ddoUID`s are even the uids you wrote, which removes the heap lookup; what
you give up is the template's panel STYLING and positions, which AIXML cannot express. The measurement
that said otherwise was taken on a ONE-frame structure, where "frames lost" and "specs lost"
are indistinguishable. `docs/labview-vit-templates.md`. So Check A catches both by
name and their Check B entries are belt and braces. The `[0] Timeout` detail belonged to `Timed Loop`
alone and had drifted onto both. Corrected in `experiments/pylabview/ROUTING.md` §2, which
contradicted `FINDINGS.md` §3.11 on this for two commits.

**A USER EVENT CARRIES DATA AND THE HANDLER READS IT — that is the DEFAULT, not the ambitious
version.** The user's rule of 2026-09-11, given twice. First by hand-correcting a generated
producer/consumer whose user-event frame pulled its payload out of front-panel **Local Variables** —
*"Es ist aber die Idee eines User Events, dass die Daten über das Event mitgegeben werden"* — and
again after a demo was built that deliberately avoided the payload because generation could not
express it. **Designing around the gap produced an example that misses the point of the construct.**
A user event used only as a trigger is a real pattern and needs a reason; it is not the default.

So: design the frame to read the payload, then make the toolchain reach it.
`ConvertAIXMLToVI` drops the field selection, so the route is a labelled placeholder constant wired
into a **prim** input plus `lvai_set_event_data_fields` as a third build step — and a front-panel
Local Variable is never the substitute, because it holds what the panel has at that instant rather
than what the event carried. `scripts/aixml-skeletons/user-event-two-loops.md` is the worked example.

**FOR A FRONT-PANEL EVENT THERE IS A CHEAPER ROUTE, AND IT DOES NOT GENERALISE TO A USER EVENT.**
A control terminal placed inside its own event frame already carries the value the event just
produced, so a front-panel frame needs **no `Event Data Node` at all** — measured 2026-09-16, a
`Not` on the control and a subVI call taking the cluster both worked with every data node deleted,
and that removes `lvai_set_event_data_fields` from the build entirely. It is worth reaching for
because wiring `NewVal` into a subVI `Call` is not reachable at all: the same measurement answered
`dataFieldsDroppedAndWired: ["NewVal","OldVal"]` with validation saying
`required input 'new value' is not wired`, since the field selection is dropped and the documented
repair wants a **prim** input.

**But it is the user's correction of 2026-09-16 that makes this safe to write down: the shortcut
holds ONLY where a control exists, and A USER EVENT HAS NONE.** Its payload lives in the
`Event Data Node` and nowhere else, so for a user event the placeholder-constant plus
`lvai_set_event_data_fields` route above is not one option of two — it is the only one. The two
cases look alike on a diagram, which is exactly why the shortcut has to be stated with its
boundary rather than as a general rule about event structures.

**SO WHEN YOU AUTHOR AN EVENT STRUCTURE, ALWAYS ROUTE THE EVENT REGISTRATION REFNUM INTO IT AS AN
ORDINARY `<Tunnel>` — even when nothing inside the frames reads it.** This is the user's rule of
2026-09-11 and it is the difference between a one-call repair and an impossible one. A `<Tunnel>` on
a `<Structure>` is something AIXML keeps; the wire onto the **dynamic event terminal** is the one
thing it cannot express, and without the tunnel that wire has to be composed across the diagram —
which pylabview cannot do either. With the tunnel, the missing piece is a BRANCH of a net that
already touches the structure, and `lvai_wire_dynamic_events` makes it in one call. An unread
tunnel costs nothing on the diagram, and it keeps the shape identical after every regeneration,
because it lives in your AIXML rather than in LabVIEW's layout.

**The tool works without it, and that is not a reason to skip it.** With no such tunnel it falls
back to the `Register For Events` node on the block diagram and wires straight across the loop
border — LabVIEW accepts that and creates the tunnel itself, measured — but then the tunnel is
LabVIEW's and your source AIXML still does not describe the net reaching the structure. `sourceFrom`
in the answer says which route ran; `tunnel` is the one to design for.

Two consequences worth knowing before you write the frames. **A wire count is not the check**:
branching the tunnel's net gives a wire of three ends, the fallback a fresh one of two, so the tool
judges on the destination terminal having a wire at all. And **only a RENDER shows the result** —
`Auto Route?` defaults to FALSE, and with the default the connection is real in every readable form
while LabVIEW draws nothing. `docs/labview-vit-templates.md` §5a has both measurements.

**"The export is faithful" is an `Event Structure` fact and does NOT generalise. For a `Timed Loop`
the export is lossy.** Measured 2026-08-22 on a controlled pair: the loop comes back as
`<Structure _name="Timed Loop" count="…" label="…"/>` with **no configuration node on either side** —
so AIXML never carries the timing at all, and two VIs whose binaries differ by 3 703 bytes produced
exports that were byte-identical apart from the VI name. Do not reason about a Timed Loop's timing
from an AIXML export; there is nothing in it to reason about.

**A Timed Loop's timing is reachable through pylabview — but only where the IDE has exposed the
attribute on the configuration node.** This is the rule to apply before promising anything about
`Period`, `Deadline`, `Timeout`, `Offset`, `Priority`, `Mode`, `Source Name` or `Assigned CPU`:

- **collapsed node** (the default, and what every VI in the experiment happened to have): the heap
  names only `Timing`, `Wakeup Reason`, `Error`, `Structure Name`. The individual fields are inside
  the `Timing` cluster and are **not** reachable. `FINDINGS.md` §3.15 measured exactly this.
- **exposed node**: each attribute becomes a real terminal with its own `TypeID` **and its own
  `DefaultData` carrying the value** — measured `Priority` = 100, `Mode` = 2, `Timeout` = -1,
  `Source Name` = `"Default"`. §3.15's "field values are absent from the parsed XML entirely" is
  false for this case; §3.16 supersedes it.

**Writing a timing value works — but only through the WIRED CONSTANT, never through the terminal.**
This is the single most important thing on this page about Timed Loops, and it took five measurements
and two wrong conclusions to reach:

| where the value comes from | element | writable? |
|---|---|---|
| a **constant wired** to the input terminal | `<ConstValue>` on the `bDConstDCO`, hex text | **yes** — verified through a LabVIEW load *and* re-save, and confirmed by LabVIEW's own AIXML export reading `value="2500"` |
| an **unwired** terminal's fallback | `<DefaultData>` on the terminal | no — LabVIEW overwrites it on its next save |
| a field inside the collapsed `Timing` cluster | `DefaultData`, flattened | no — the rebuilt VI will not load at all |

So the recipe is: **the inputs must be wired in the IDE once** — that is a diagram edit, and adding a
constant plus a wire is composition, which pylabview cannot do (no composing from nothing) and AIXML
cannot express here (its export drops the configuration node). Given the wire, changing the number is
a one-line substitution: find the `ConstValue`, write the new hex, rebuild. `ConstValue` is plain hex
with no MacRoman, no CDATA and no entity escaping, and the file size does not change — none of the
`DefaultData` traps apply. `docs`-side detail in §3.19; §3.17 and §3.18 record the two blind alleys.

**Wiring the inputs also makes the values visible to AIXML**, which §3.16 got too broadly: AIXML is
blind to the configuration *node* and its terminals, but a wired constant is an ordinary diagram
object, so it exports with its name and value — `Mode` even with its five enum item strings.

The two routes that do NOT work, kept because each fails in an instructive way:

| what was patched | result |
|---|---|
| the **collapsed** node's flattened `Timing` cluster | LabVIEW **refuses the file**: `load error code 6: Could not load block diagram` |
| the **exposed terminal**'s own 4-byte `DefaultData` | loads with `errorCode 0`, then **LabVIEW overwrites it on its next save** |

**Because these attributes are WIRED inputs, not stored settings.** A Timed Loop's `Timeout` is an
input terminal; a value reaches it from a constant or control wired to it on the diagram.
`DefaultData` is only the fallback for an unwired terminal, and LabVIEW treats it as its own to
regenerate. Editing it changes nothing and does not survive. Setting a timeout for real means the
value must arrive **on a wire** — so the IDE is needed for the wiring, once, and nothing more:
after that the number lives in `ConstValue` and is ours. §3.18 has the reasoning, §3.17 the two
blind alleys, §3.19 the working edit.

**LOGIC inside a construct AIXML refuses is reachable too — through a subVI `Call` used as a
slot.** This is the general escape from "AIXML cannot author it, pylabview cannot compose it", and
it is worth reaching for before declaring anything impossible:

- AIXML refuses a `Timed Loop` even hand-authored (`Error 53`, `Unsupported node type`), and
  pylabview adds no nodes and no wires. So logic *inside* the loop looks unreachable.
- It is not, once a person has put **one subVI `Call` inside the construct** in the IDE. That Call
  is a socket. AIXML authors the plug — a subVI, with no restriction on its contents — and
  `scripts/pylv-retarget-subvi.py` swaps which plug sits in it.
- **Verified 2026-08-22**: a Timed Loop's Call retargeted from `alternate.vi` to `alternate2.vi` by
  three text substitutions plus `pylv_rebuild`; LabVIEW's own export then read
  `target="alternate2.vi"` with the loop, its `Timeout`/`Period`, the stop button and the indicator
  untouched.
- The constraint is the **connector pane contract**: same terminal names and types, because the
  heap's wires bind to the pane. Check both VIs with `lvai_connector_pane`, and AIXML-export the
  result — `pylv_rebuild` reporting `ok` says nothing about whether the swap was sound.

So the IDE is needed **once per socket**, never again for what goes into it. Nothing about this is
specific to Timed Loops; it applies to any construct the generator refuses, `Event Structure`
included. `scripts/templates/README.md` has the substitution sites and the measurement.

**Two process rules came out of getting this wrong**, and they generalise well past Timed Loops:

- **Ask how a value ARRIVES before hunting where it is stored.** A wired input, a terminal default
  and a dialog field look alike in a heap dump and behave nothing alike. Three measurements went into
  "where is the byte" when the question was "who writes it".
- **`pylv_rebuild` succeeding is not verification.** Read the value back **after LabVIEW has loaded
  and saved the VI** — that is the first moment LabVIEW gets a vote, and it is where `2500` turned
  into something else. `lvai_set_vi_icon` forces that save cheaply (`viResaved: true`).

If you do ever edit a heap payload, two encoding rules apply: **keep the LF line endings** (Python's
text mode turns them into CRLF and all 20 000 lines then differ, hiding the one that changed), and
**let the CDATA wrapper follow the content** — `&#x00;` is literal text inside CDATA but an invalid
character reference outside it.

**Reading those values needs two encoding facts, each of which produced confident nonsense first.**
pylabview renders `DefaultData` as **MacRoman** — byte `0xFF` returns as U+02C7, so a `Timeout` of
`-1` decodes to garbage under latin-1 or UTF-8. And bytes with no printable form are written as the
**literal six-character text** `&#x00;`, not as an XML character reference, so an XML parser hands
them over unresolved. `scripts/pylv-decode-terminals.py` handles both — use it rather than
re-deriving them.

**Do not expect the AIXML route to be the common one when editing.** Measured over 900 VIs of a
production codebase: **70 % call the project's own subVIs**, which AIXML refuses with `Error 53`, and
87 % of all subVI calls go into own code. The same 70 % turns up independently in NI's example corpus
(737 of 1052 regeneration failures). Only **15 %** carry no unsupported construct at all, and that is
an upper bound rather than a promise. `docs/aixml-gap-census.md` has the whole table, including what
is *rarer* than expected — `Timed Loop` was one VI in 900.

**`pylv_route` decides; it does not switch.** A pylabview edit is a surgical change to an object
heap — in one measured case six specific text edits, and they were only knowable because AIXML had
generated a reference VI to diff against. That cannot be synthesised from "add error handling", so
authoring the edit stays yours. `experiments/pylabview/ROUTING.md` §5 lists the six process gates;
the one that has cost the most time is releasing the path from LabVIEW's memory before rebuilding,
because pylabview writes the file happily while LabVIEW keeps serving its stale in-memory copy — so
a verification run confirms the VI you REPLACED.

**Run the whole pylabview cycle through `pylv_apply`, which enforces that order for you.** One call
does close-project → extract → your operations → rebuild → AIXML-export to verify, and the bundle
becomes an implementation detail: deleted on success, kept and named on failure. Call it with **no
operations first** — that mode is read-only, does not close the project, and returns all three
listings (pane `--show`, subVI link table, diagram-comment anchors) in one answer, which is what an
operations array is written from. A malformed operation is refused *before* the extract, by name, so
a typo costs a message rather than a half-applied bundle. It does not relieve you of the connector
pane contract on a retarget, and it says so. Measured 2026-08-25: inspect 1.4 s, a pattern repair
end to end 1.9 s, a retarget plus two comment placements 3.4 s. `docs/bulk-operations.md`.

The rule the tool encodes is still worth knowing, because you will meet it whenever you drive the
scripts directly:

**CLOSE THE PROJECT, not the VI.** `lvai_close_active_project` is the move; this clause used to name
`lvai_close_vi`, and following it literally is what wedged a session on 2026-08-24. `lvai_close_vi`
requires the project to be *active* to work at all, so it leaves the project loaded — and the usual
way to make a project active is `lvai_open_file`, which makes LabVIEW **compile** the VI. From then
on the file carries `VICD` compiled-code blocks (with `BNID`, `CNST`, `GCDI`, `NUID`, `SUID`), and
**pylabview copies those through unparsed** — the same property that makes the round trip lossless
now preserves compiled code describing the state *before* your edit.

Measured on the same VI pair twice over: the round whose bundle had **0** `VICD` blocks generated,
pane-fixed, retargeted, ran and wrote its TDMS and CSV; the round with **3** returned `1039, VI was
aborted` on the first run and wedged LabVIEW on the second — every service port answering
`DeadlineExceeded` while the process still answered the OS, which needed a restart. Nothing about the
heap edits differed. So the order is: **close the project → extract → edit → rebuild → only then let
LabVIEW load it.** A regeneration hitting `Error 1357` is a reason to close the project, never a
reason to open it.

**AND CLOSING THE PROJECT IS NOT ENOUGH WHEN THE VI WAS CONVERTED WITH ITS CALLEES LOADED — the
file already carries `VICD` the moment it is written, so `pylv_apply` STRIPS THE COMPILED CODE on
every edit since 2026-09-29.** Found from a user's crash report blaming a Flat Sequence; reproduced
as a 2x2 A/B here, and the Flat Sequence was not the variable: a `panePattern` rebuild alone gave
`result 0` where the unedited VI gives `8`, with `error out` clean, `execState 1` and every answer
`ok`, while LabVIEW's log read `was trying to execute when it had not been compiled correctly`. On
the user's 64-bit LabVIEW the same route CRASHED. The strip makes the VI source-only, and the saved
file is checked for a leftover `VICD` afterwards, because no session-level reading saw this.
`docs/pylabview-stale-compiled-code.md`.

**Not every working measurement becomes a tool.** A repeatable operation on the user's own LabVIEW
code gets productised — helper file under `scripts/`, an `lvai_*` tool, tests, docs, on its own
branch. A one-shot investigation of NI's internals gets written down instead: `lvai_inventory.xml`
produced its 419-row table in 16 seconds and still stayed a script plus a `docs/` table, because
it only needs re-running after an addon update. When it is genuinely borderline, build the script,
say plainly that it could become a tool, and let the caller decide.

## When a tool call fails

**`An error occurred invoking 'lvai_…'` is OUR message, not the client's.** It is the MCP SDK masking
an exception thrown while binding the arguments, and the detail — exception, stack, the parameter at
fault — goes to the server's **stderr**, where no client looks. Issue #19 concluded the opposite, that
a client rejected the call before it ever reached the server; the first reading of that issue in this
repository agreed with it. Both were wrong, measured 2026-08-14 by driving the built exe over raw
stdio with no client in between: same call, same sentence.

Since then the server answers argument problems with data. A near-miss spelling is folded onto the
declared one (`vi_path` → `viPath`, `max_content_chars` → `maxContentChars`), and a genuinely missing
argument comes back as `{"ok": false, "errorKind": "badArguments", …}` naming what is missing, what
arrived, and every accepted name with its type. So **seeing the masked sentence again means the
wrapper is not in place** — check that `WithArgumentDiagnostics()` still runs last in `Program.cs`,
and read stderr. Detail and the re-measuring recipe in `docs/tool-argument-errors.md`.

**AN ARGUMENT NAME THAT IS NOT DECLARED IS NOW REFUSED BY NAME — it used to be dropped in silence,
and on an all-optional tool nothing downstream noticed.** The fold handles a NEAR miss (`vi_path` →
`viPath`, by normalising `_`, `-` and case); a name that resembles nothing — `path`, `filePath` —
matched no rule and simply vanished, so the tool ran with everything empty and LabVIEW answered
about the wrong thing. Measured twice on `lvai_open_file`: 2026-08-27 with `filePath`, and
2026-09-14 with `path`, the second costing **five `Error 7, File not found` answers over three paths
that plainly exist, a refuted A/B on the foreground window, and a LabVIEW kill and restart.**
`lvai_open_file` also refuses a call naming NO file, which is the one shape no argument layer can
catch because there is nothing there to misspell.

**AND THE SECOND HALF IS THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY FIRES HERE — measured on acceptance the same day.**
**The Claude desktop client validates arguments against the served schema and DROPS an undeclared key
before sending**, so the server never sees it: from the client the same `{"path": …}` call answers
`received: {viPath: null, …}` from the TOOL's guard, while over raw stdio it answers
`unrecognised: ["path"]` from the argument layer. So from a client a made-up name and an empty call
are **indistinguishable**, and the argument-layer refusal is unreachable. It is still worth having —
nothing in the MCP contract makes a client strip unknown keys — but **a tool whose parameters are
ALL optional needs its own guard for "these arguments ask for nothing"**, because that is the shape
no argument layer can reach. `docs/tool-argument-errors.md` has both routes side by side.

**AND THE SAME SILENCE LIVES ONE LAYER IN, INSIDE ANY `casesJson`.** The argument wrapper guards a
tool's **MCP arguments**; a case list arrives as a JSON STRING it never inspects, so an unknown key
there was exactly as silent as an undeclared argument used to be. Measured 2026-09-15: two test
agents independently reached for a plausible `expectFieldValue` on `lvai_generate_method_test`, had
it discarded, and got **`ok: true`** for a suite whose assertion asserted the OPPOSITE of the one
asked for — `writeField`+`value` pins that the field SURVIVED the call, and the method under test was
a `Zero` whose whole job is to overwrite it, so the suite pinned `12.5 == 0`. Both fell back to
hand-authored AIXML for the one test in each suite that mattered most.

Unknown keys are refused by name there now, with the accepted set listed, and **deliberately not
folded onto a near miss** — folding is a second behaviour that can itself be wrong, and the measured
defect is the silence. A **recognised** key with the wrong value kind was the same fault from
another side: `expectErrorCode` was read only as a JSON number, so a quoted `"-200099"` vanished,
and every other value in a case IS a string. **Refusing a key that names a real capability would
only move the cost**, so `expectFieldValue` became a fourth case shape at the same time — fifteen
lines, because the generator already authored the expected literal and merely reused the written
constant on purpose, which is right for a round trip and wrong for a method that changes the field.
The default LABEL had to move with it (`Reading survives Zero` would document the opposite), and a
Caraya failure body is the literal `"FAIL"`, so the label is very nearly all a reader gets.
**ALL THREE `casesJson` TOOLS REFUSE AN UNKNOWN KEY NOW** — `lvai_generate_test` accepts
`label`/`inputs`/`expect`, `lvai_generate_class_test` accepts `field`/`value`/`label`/`type`, and
the check is **one** implementation, `TestTools.RejectUnknownCaseKeys`, with the method-test tool
moved onto it. Three copies of one rule drift, and this repository has paid for that already:
`AixmlCheck.SafeUidBase` and the lint's ceiling disagreed for days while telling readers their
compliant files were wrong. Two things made the extension safe rather than a new defect. **The
accepted set was read out of each parser IN FULL, never grepped** — a set one key short refuses a
legitimate call, which is worse than the silence it replaces, and two grep patterns had already
given two different answers. And **each refusal carries a hint naming the tool that CAN do the
thing** (the class-test one points at `expectFieldValue`), because refusing without saying where to
go only moves the cost. Nothing has been measured going wrong on those two; the rule is applied
where the same hole exists so the three answer alike. `docs/cold-build-torquebench.md` §4.

**AND A `default` IN THE SERVED SCHEMA MADE THE CLIENT DEMAND THE ARGUMENT - measured 2026-09-16,
fixed the same day.** `MCP error -32602 ... "expected": "nonoptional"` on a parameter that has a C#
default and was omitted, six times in one build across five tools. **The schema was RIGHT**: dumped
over raw stdio, `required` held only the genuinely required names and **not one defaulted parameter
appeared in any `required` array across all 75 tools** - so `required` was never what the client was
reading. The discriminator is the `default` KEY, and the session carried its own control: the
`lvai_*` tools were the only ones emitting `default` and the only ones refusing an omitted optional,
while `Bash` (`timeout`) and `Agent` (`model`) declare theirs with no `default` and take an omitted
one happily. `ClientSchema.WithoutDefaults` now strips it from what is served and folds the value
into the DESCRIPTION instead - `default` is an annotation in JSON Schema, so this constrains nothing
and `required` is untouched, and the wrapper keeps diagnosing against the ORIGINAL schema so a
refusal still prints `integer, default 180`. **A client-side refusal never reaches the server**,
which is why no argument layer or tool guard could ever have answered this one.
`docs/tool-argument-errors.md`.

**AND A NEW PARAMETER CANNOT BE ACCEPTANCE-TESTED IN THE SESSION THAT ADDED IT.** Measured
2026-09-15 on `lvai_close_active_project`'s new `projectPath`: seven closes, every one answering
`reason: "noProjectPathGiven"`, **not one sweep run** — while the DLL carried the new strings and
the server process had started two minutes AFTER that build. The server was never the problem. A
client fetches the tool list **once, at session start**, and validates against that copy, so a key
declared later is stripped before sending and the server sees a call that never had it. Restarting
the server changes nothing; only a new session re-fetches the schema. Two consequences worth
carrying: a `reason` naming a missing argument must also say that **a session older than the
argument cannot send one**, because it is read exactly when someone is already confused; and the
first diagnosis — "the server process predates the rebuild" — was **refuted by the timestamps while
recommending the right remedy anyway**, which is the `"only a restart fixes it"` shape all over
again. Plan the acceptance test for after the restart, and until then say the wiring is untested
rather than implying it works.

**ACCEPTED in the next session, and the control is the half that made it mean anything.** With the
client restarted the parameter appeared in the served schema, and three arms settled it: with
`projectPath` the sweep answered `swept: true` and removed the `<userlib>/LV_MCP` socket by name
while the `/&lt;vilib&gt;/Astemes/LUnit/Test Case.lvclass` entry survived a real LabVIEW
`Save` -> `Close` -> sweep; **without** it a re-added stray SURVIVED, proving the sweep is gated on
the argument rather than accidentally always-on; and with nothing active it answered
`nothingWasClosed` and left the file alone. That first arm is also **the first time the `<vilib>`
data-loss fix has been exercised against a live LabVIEW save** — every earlier check was read-only.
**Build the fixture out of files that EXIST**: a project entry whose file is missing opens a modal
search dialog on load, and a modal stops the whole gRPC service, so the dangling case stays in the
unit tests and never goes in front of a live LabVIEW. The `noProjectPathGiven` note now says
outright that a session older than the parameter cannot send one — which had been written down as a
recommendation and changed nothing until it was put in the code.
`docs/cold-build-torquebench.md` §2.

**The process lesson is bigger than the fix, and it is about how this file is written.**
`docs/tool-argument-errors.md` had described the 2026-08-27 failure exactly — and ended it *"this
layer cannot do better on its own"*. **That impossibility claim was an inference, written in the same
voice as the measurements around it, and it is what stopped anyone looking again for 18 days.** The
wrapper holds the schema and the supplied keys in the same method; naming an unmatched key is four
lines. **Write down what was measured and leave the "cannot" out** — a limit stated as a fact is
read as one, and this file's whole method is that a documented measurement saves the next session.
The tool's own description compounded it by explaining a mechanism that does not exist (`filePath`
"is folded onto `viPath`" — it is not, it is dropped), which sends the reader hunting for a path that
was never passed: **when a description explains a MECHANISM, check the mechanism**, because it is
read at the moment someone is already confused.

## When LabVIEW disappears

**Starting LabVIEW through our tools EMPTIES the auto-save store first.** Both
`lvai_ensure_labview` and `LabVIEWMCP --ensure-labview` clear
`<Documents>\LabVIEW Data\LVAutoSave` recursively - files and subdirectories, everything but the
store's own folder - and only when they start LabVIEW themselves; a process already running owns its
own recovery data. `--keep-autosave` / `keepAutoSave: true` opts out.

**The reason is the modal dialog, not the crash.** Leftover auto-save data makes LabVIEW offer
recovery on start, and a modal dialog stops the whole gRPC service until a human dismisses it - which
in an unattended start is nobody. The path is resolved through the Documents *known folder* rather
than built from `%USERPROFILE%`, because Documents is commonly redirected and a hardcoded path would
clear a directory nothing reads.

**It is NOT a fix for the disappearances, and the measurement says so.** With `LVAutoSave` verified
empty, validating an AIXML file naming an uncatalogued VI Server class still killed LabVIEW in eight
seconds, same two `OMAutoClasses` entries, zero new archives. The archives are written when LabVIEW
*starts* and finds leftovers from an abnormal end, so a pile of them counts past crashes rather than
causing the next one - eight in one day looked exactly like a cause and was not.

**THE UID BASE IS 4200, AND TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THAT RULE DISAGREED FOR DAYS.**
`AixmlCheck.SafeUidBase` is 4200 and `scripts/aixml_lint.py`'s `LOW_UID_CEILING` was 5000, so the
lint flagged `uid-low` on every file the generators themselves emit — and its own comment argued
the ceiling MOVES (42 to 163 observed over 132 blocks), which is true and does not support 5000.
Settled 2026-09-14 by measurement on a LabVIEW up ~50 minutes, **with a control, because a probe
that detects nothing proves nothing**: four elements at uids 4200-4230 moved `dwarnCount` 7 → 7,
the same four at uids 10-13 moved it 7 → 11, one event per element, and the control's own message
named the live ceiling — `max: 69 sat: 67`. So 4200 clears the highest observed ceiling by 26×; the
lint is now 4200 too. **Keep the two equal**: a second implementation that disagrees is worse than
either alone, and this one spent days telling readers their compliant files were wrong.

**MOST OF A COLD BUILD'S DWARNS ARE OURS, and they come from uids inside LabVIEW's RESERVED RANGE.**
Measured 2026-09-07 as a controlled pair — one socket-shaped VI through `ConvertAIXMLToVI` twice,
identical but for four numbers: uids `10,11,12,13` cost **4** warnings, `4200,4210,4220,4230` cost
**0**. One warning per element per generation, deterministic. A cold four-class build logged 24 of
them, 60 % of that run's 40 warnings. So `TestTools.UidBase = 4200` now numbers everything the
TOOLS emit — the class-test and method-test sockets, and the suite runner, whose `here`/`strip`/
`array` were being repaired on every build. **The `scripts\` helpers are deliberately NOT
renumbered**: they were measured silent and are generated once, and `docs/labview-crash-signatures.md`
warns against renumbering 39 files on a rule rather than a measurement. It is worth doing not
because the warnings cause anything — unestablished — but because `dwarnCount` saturates and
`looksDegraded` flips with it, so a signature we emit ourselves crowds out the ones that might mean
something.

**AND `dwarnCount` COUNTED LOG LINES, NOT EVENTS, UNTIL 2026-09-08 — so every DWarn figure written
down here before that date is doubled.** NI writes each event twice: a bare line, then the same
message prefixed `source\…cpp(N) : `. Measured with a controlled probe, because one sample cannot
tell a format from a coincidence — four diagram objects at reserved uids log one event each, and
the substring count went 2 → 10 while `) : DWarn` lines and `<DEBUG_OUTPUT>` blocks both went
1 → 5. Exactly 2×. The counter now reports **events**, names the rule in `dwarnCountedBy`, and both
thresholds are halved to keep their calibration: the observed cap of 200 lines is **100 events**,
and `looksDegraded` fires at 25. Ratios and deltas in every earlier analysis stand; only absolute
magnitudes were inflated — the `4` in the paragraph above is an event count, re-measured, and the
`24 of 40` pair is of unrecoverable unit.

**The lesson is the propagation, not the arithmetic: this was ALREADY WRITTEN DOWN and changed
nothing.** `docs/labview-crash-signatures.md` says outright, in the middle of one analysis, that
"`dwarnCount` counts LINES while each event writes two" — halves by hand, correctly, and then no
other passage in that document, none in this file, and not one line of code was brought into step.
Same shape as an embedded document nothing serves. **When a measurement contradicts a number, fix
the thing that PRODUCES the number, not just the paragraph you happen to be writing.**

**A DWARN CLUSTER TAGGED WITH ONE VI IS NOT CAUSED BY THAT VI, and settling it needs an A/B rather
than a fix.** Measured 2026-09-07: a 33-minute class build left 38 new DWarns, *every* one tagged
`[Executing: lvai_close_active_project.vi]` — 15 `DestroyPlatformEvent failed with MgErr 42`, 3
`bad parent in MoveItem`. That helper did leak the project refnum, so the two looked connected. They
are not: building the pre-fix helper (the same AIXML with the one `Close Reference` removed) and
alternating the two over four closes in the same state gave **0, 2, 1, 0** warnings, pre-fix and
fixed alike. And `bad parent in MoveItem` did not reproduce once in those four, so it depends on
what LabVIEW holds in MEMORY — the `Save` adopting every open VI — not on the close's wiring.

Two process lessons, both cheap: **the `Executing:` tag names where the warning was emitted, not
what caused it**, and **two measurements do not separate two distributions whose values are 0, 1 and
2** — after round 2 the reading was "the fix causes them", the exact opposite of the hypothesis, and
just as wrong. `docs/labview-crash-signatures.md`.

**AND THE `Save` BEFORE THE `Close` IS NOT THE CAUSE EITHER — tested, 2026-09-07, seven closes.**
It was the last standing hypothesis, because a project save is documented here as making LabVIEW
adopt every open VI and `bad parent in MoveItem` is a project-tree complaint. Built the helper with
the `Save` node removed and alternated: **with the Save 0, 2, 0, 0; without it 0, 3, 0** — and the
same condition gave 2 and 0 on two runs, so the condition does not determine the count either.
**Keep the `Save`**: it costs nothing measurable, and dropping it re-opens the modal-save-prompt
hazard that stops the whole gRPC service. A `saveFirst: false` option was considered and NOT added.
Two things fell out of it: `MoveItem` did not reproduce ONCE in seven closes, so it needs a
condition none of them created — VIs **generated** while the project is open, rather than merely
loaded or opened, is the only surviving candidate; and **a non-member VI open in the IDE was NOT
adopted by the save**, so "LabVIEW adopts every VI it has open" is at best incomplete as written.

**Read NI's own log, not the Windows event log.** LabVIEW installs its own crash handler: it catches
the fault, writes `%TEMP%\LabVIEW_32_<ver>_interactive_<user>_cur.txt` plus a minidump, and exits.
Windows Error Reporting never sees it, so an empty Application log is **not an alibi**. Measured
2026-08-26 after three disappearances in one session were nearly attributed to the wrong cause on
exactly that reasoning - the event-log query was sound, returning 150 other events, and still said
nothing.

`_cur.txt` is overwritten on the next start, so **copy it before restarting**. Grep it for `DWarn`,
`minidump id` and `Executing:`.

**AND THERE IS A SECOND LOG — the gRPC service is not in LabVIEW, so LabVIEW's log is not its log.**
`%ProgramData%\National Instruments\AIAssistants\Logs`, the user's pointer of 2026-09-17. The
service belongs to the **Nigel Local Service**, a separate process, and it records its own
lifecycle: `Initializing Nigel Local Service`, two `Now listening on:` lines with the ports, one
`Started monitoring for requests.` per feature, and — when it loses LabVIEW —
`Stopped monitoring due to exception. Status(StatusCode="Unavailable", …)` per feature. **That is
the direct answer to `lvai_status`'s `Unavailable` triage without a single gRPC call.** It rotates
at 2 MiB, so take the newest mtime rather than the base name.

**The ports it logs are a hint and not a rule**: measured twice on 2026-09-16 the lvai port was one
above the logged https port (52948→52949, 50773→50774), but an earlier start in the same file logged
its own http and https five apart. Read the real port from `lvai_status`.

**Its SILENCE is evidence too, and it corrected a diagnosis the same day.** When LabVIEW vanished
mid-session, LabVIEW's log stopped four minutes before the last successful call and no minidump
followed, which was read as "no crash evidence, so a clean exit". The Nigel log shows **nothing at
all** for that moment — while it logged six `Stopped monitoring` lines for a shutdown forty-five
minutes earlier. Two shutdowns, two different traces: the right conclusion is *unlike the one this
service did record, and unexplained*, most consistent with the Local Service going too. **An absence
of evidence is only informative once you know the thing writes evidence when it works** — the same
mistake as trusting an empty Windows event log, one layer in.

**And validation is not risk-free, which contradicts how this file describes it elsewhere.** The
signature found twice was NI's own code:

```
source\ole\OMAutoClasses.cpp(74) : DWarn 0x762E6013:
    Out of bounds TypedObjList access (index: -1, nObj: 0)
[Executing: "LV AI Core.lvlibp:VI generator.vi"]   <- called from ValidateAIXML.vi
```

`OMAutoClasses` is the VI Server automation class registry; `index: -1, nObj: 0` is a name looked up
in an empty list and then used as an index. It fires while LabVIEW PARSES AIXML, and every instance
was validating a file naming classes the catalogue does not list - `{LV.LVClassLibrary}`,
`{LV.Project}`, `{LV.Panel}`, `{LV.Cluster}`. Correlation, not proven cause; the crash site is what is
established.

So keep using `lvai_validate_aixml` - it is still the cheap failure path - but know that a helper is
validated **once and then cached** under `%TEMP%\LabVIEWMCP\helpers\`, and do not delete that cache
to force a rebuild unless the AIXML actually changed. A development loop that regenerates every
iteration pays the risk every iteration, which is how three deaths happened in one afternoon.
`docs/labview-crash-signatures.md` has the other crash points, including `Open project application
ref.vi` - the `Project\3AActive Project` route itself.

## Writing things down

**Empirically derived `lvai` behaviour belongs in `docs/`, not only in the conversation.** This
interface is private and undocumented; every measured fact is expensive to obtain and cheap to
lose. Record the measurement *and* the symptom that led to it, so the next reader recognises the
failure rather than re-deriving it.

Correct a document when a measurement contradicts it, and say what the old text claimed. The
call-target table in `docs/aixml-reference.md` once ruled out library-qualified targets; read
literally it argued away 600 usable palette VIs.

The seven documents served by an `lvai_*_reference` tool are **embedded in the assembly** and
byte-verified on every build, so a binary-only install answers the same questions. See "Installing
on another machine" in the README — which now ships too, rather than being named and left behind.
`docs/example-corpus.md` is deliberately not *embedded*: it records how the example data is stored
on disk, which the index reads for itself, so no tool has to hand it out at run time. It is still
**copied** with the rest of `docs\`, so it is readable on any install; not embedding it and not
shipping it were run together in this paragraph until 2026-08-23.

**Editing an embedded document needs no copying anywhere — only a rebuild.** The `.csproj` includes
the file itself (`<EmbeddedResource Include="..\..\docs\aixml-reference.md" …/>`), so there is no
second copy to keep in step, and `EmbeddedDocumentIsByteIdenticalToTheFileInDocs` fails if one ever
appears. `CLAUDE.md` is both embedded and copied to `claude\CLAUDE.md`; everything under `scripts\`
is copied with `PreserveNewest`. So a new helper script ships as soon as it is written.

**EMBEDDED AND SHIPPED ARE DIFFERENT THINGS, and conflating them cost nine dangling pointers.** An
embedded resource lives inside the DLL and is reachable only through whatever tool serves it, so a
document that is embedded but unserved is invisible on a binary-only install — and a document that
is neither is not there at all. Audited 2026-08-23: the table above pointed at
`aixml-gap-census.md`, `aixml-node-gaps.tsv`, `example-corpus.md`, `lvai-internal-vis.tsv`,
`pylabview-controls.md`, `tool-argument-errors.md` and `README.md`, none of which shipped, and two
of those are cited by *embedded* documents rather than only by this one.

Since then the build **copies all of `docs\` and `README.md`** next to the exe, about 900 kB, so
every row resolves. The eight served documents stay embedded as well: a tool answer must not depend
on a file beside the exe surviving. Nothing about `docs\` needs a `.csproj` edit any more — the glob
takes new files automatically, and `NoCustomerOrProductIdentifiersAnywhereInTheDocsFolder` walks the
folder so a new document is covered by the confidentiality guard the moment it exists.

**"THE BUILD" IN THAT SENTENCE MEANT THE `.csproj`, AND THE RELEASE ARCHIVE IS A SEPARATE LIST.**
Audited 2026-09-11: the csproj stages `README.md` next to the exe and `release.yml`'s staging step
did not, so a plugin install was the one route with no `README.md` at all — while the paragraph
above asserted flatly that the build copies it. Fixed in the workflow (`bin/README.md`), and the
lesson is the one this section already teaches one layer in: **there are now TWO lists of what
ships** — the `.csproj` globs for a local build, and the staging step for the archive — and a file
added to one is not in the other. `docs\` and `scripts\` are globbed in both; everything named
individually (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude\settings.json`) has to be added twice.

**`experiments/` still ships nothing** — absent from the `.csproj`, embedded and copied alike, and
`pylv_route`/`pylv_status` only *mention* `ROUTING.md` and `FINDINGS.md` in code comments rather than
serving them. Those two rows are marked "source tree only". The consequence for writing: a rule that
has to survive into a shipped build belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or one of the served documents, with
`experiments/` holding the evidence behind it. Putting the rule only in `FINDINGS.md` means it is
not installed — which is exactly how the Timed Loop slot pattern came to be re-derived from scratch.

## The agent definitions

**The unit-test agent is per FRAMEWORK, and `labview-class-generator` always calls one.** Caraya is
the default (`labview-caraya-unit-test`), and LUnit and VI Tester have their own agents —
`labview-lunit-unit-test` and `labview-vitester-unit-test`, both added 2026-08-29 as scaffolds.
**LUnit is no longer a scaffold: it was installed 2026-09-01 and the whole route is measured end to
end** — a test case class off `Test Case.lvclass`, two test methods, one `Passed` and a deliberately
wrong one `Failed`, JUnit report written. `docs/labview-lunit-testing.md` is the evidence, and
**`lvai_lunit_add_test_method` plus `lvai_run_lunit_tests` are the two tools** — added after a
six-method suite over a four-field class cost **85 calls** by hand, because every step below the
AIXML authoring is mechanical and never varies. The first collapses convert-without-validating,
the 4815 pane repair, the retype and the class-membership step into one call for many methods; the
second runs a suite and returns the report parsed. `lvai_placeholder_subvi` was fixed in the same
pass: it used to answer `stubRefused` for any class pane, and now writes those terminals as `path`
stand-ins and says which. This
paragraph said "LUnit is absent from `vi.lib\addons`, `user.lib` and `LVAddons` entirely" and that
was measured against the **64-bit** tree while LUnit installs into
`C:\Program Files (x86)\...\LabVIEW 2026` — the 32-bit build, which is the one hosting the gRPC
service. **Resolve the install root from the running process, never from a guess** —
`Get-Process LabVIEW | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path`. There is **no 64-bit LabVIEW on this
machine**: `C:\Program Files\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2023`, `2024`, `2025` and `2026` all exist
and each holds **exactly one entry, `resource`**, with no `LabVIEW.exe`, no `vi.lib` and no
`user.lib`. They are leftover stubs, and sweeping them for a toolkit reads exactly like "not
installed".

This paragraph blamed that empty listing on **the Bash tool's sandbox filtering `C:\Program Files`**
for a few hours on 2026-09-01, and that was wrong — retracted here because a false rule about a tool
is worse than no rule. PowerShell returns the identical one-entry listing, and Bash reads the whole
**32-bit** tree (22 entries at the root) and `user.lib\LV_MCP\` with correct sizes and timestamps.
Bash does not lie under `Program Files`; those folders are simply empty. The lesson is the older one
this file keeps relearning: **before concluding a tool is filtering your view, check whether the thing
you are looking for is there at all** — two tools agreeing is what settles it, and PowerShell had
already agreed in the same session.

**VI Tester remains a scaffold** — it only *ships* files under `vi.lib\addons\_JKI Toolkits` with
nothing about it ever measured here. It carries the framework-independent rules — which are
toolchain properties and do transfer — and a Phase 0 that establishes a callable target and returns
`CANNOT PROCEED` when it cannot. **Neither may substitute Caraya**, because the framework is the
user's choice and only the default is ours. A scaffold contains almost no target spellings on
purpose: inventing a name is what preceded three LabVIEW crashes, and the way to get one is to export
a VI that already calls the framework. The
class agent's Phase 6 is the handoff and is not conditional on tests having been asked for. Carved out
of the class agent on 2026-08-29 at the user's request, because testing and class creation share
almost nothing.

The eight `labview-*` agents in `.claude/agents/` are read at **session start**, so a change to one
of them — or a new one, as `labview-class-generator` was on 2026-08-28 — needs a client restart
before it can be spawned.

**The plugin ships its OWN copy of each of them, and that copy is GENERATED — never edit
`plugin/agents/` by hand.** The two differ in one thing only: the same server is `labview` when a
user registers it directly and `plugin_labview-mcp_labview` when it arrives as a plugin, so every
name in the frontmatter `tools:` list changes, and an agent carrying the wrong flavour registers
happily and can then call no LabVIEW tool at all. `scripts/Sync-PluginAgents.ps1` rewrites the
prefix (`-Check` reports drift without writing) and `PluginAgentTests` fails the test run when the
folders disagree.

Hand-maintaining the two did not work, measured 2026-08-30: `plugin/agents/` held **three** of the
seven that existed then, and all three were stale forks — the class generator and the three unit-test agents shipped
to nobody, and the three that did ship had missed several rules added since. Nothing reported it
because nothing compared them, which is the same shape as the embedded-but-unshipped documents
above: a file being in the repository says nothing about it being in the artefact people install.

**A definition whose YAML frontmatter does not parse is skipped in silence, and the error names the
wrong cause.** What you get is `Agent type 'labview-vi-generator' not found`, which reads as "the
file is missing" and sends you looking at paths — while all three files sat in the right directory
with valid content. The fault was one character sequence in the `description:` value: an unquoted
YAML plain scalar **cannot contain `: `**, colon followed by space, and all three descriptions had
one (`IMPORTANT for the orchestrator: pass in …`). Nothing warns, and the agent simply does not
appear in the roster.

So **keep `description:` a folded block scalar** — `description: >-`, with the text indented two
spaces on the next line. Inside a block scalar, colons, quotes and `#` are all literal, which
matters here because these descriptions carry both `"` and apostrophes and would need escaping in
either quoting style. Measured 2026-08-13: with the block scalar all three agents registered on the
next restart; before it none of them did.

The fallback while they were invisible was `general-purpose` with the definition handed over as a
task prompt. That works, and it is worth knowing it works — but it is not free: the same VI took
5 min 07 s and 5 min 43 s that way against **4 min 06 s** as a registered agent, because a
registered definition is the subagent's system prompt instead of a 31 kB file it has to read for
itself first.

## Build and test

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .githooks/run-tests.ps1
```

Use the second one rather than a bare `dotnet test`: a running MCP server holds an OS lock on the
exe, and the script stops it first. After either command the `lvai_*` tools are gone from the
current session until the client is restarted — nothing is lost, but plan the restart.

**THE PRE-PUSH GATE USED TO TEST THE WRONG TREE FROM A WORKTREE, and reported PASS for it.**
Measured 2026-09-11. `run-tests.ps1` derived the tree under test from its own location, and
`core.hooksPath` is git *config* — shared between a repository and every linked worktree, and stored
here as an ABSOLUTE path in `.git/worktrees/<name>/config.worktree`. So a push from
`.claude/worktrees/<name>` ran the MAIN checkout's script and tested whatever was at `main`: the hook
printed `Passed: 1625` where the worktree's own run printed `1667`, the 42 difference being exactly
the branch's two new test files. **A green gate for an unrelated tree is worse than no gate**, and the
only tell was a count nobody compares. It now resolves with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` — git runs
a hook with the pushed worktree as its working directory, measured with a probe hook — prints the tree
and the test project it resolved, and `-ResolveOnly` shows the aim without building.

**The same question was asked wrong in two more places, both fixed, and the signal was always a GREEN
result about someone else's code.** `AixmlCheckTests.RepoRoot` walked for a *directory* called `.git`
— a linked worktree's `.git` is a **FILE**, so the walk went past it and linted `main`'s `scripts\`;
`Directory.Build.targets` guarded on `Exists('.git')`, which MSBuild satisfies with that same file, so
its one-time hook setup re-ran on every worktree build and emitted three `MSB3371` warnings per build
for a marker it could never write. **Never identify this repository by `.git`** — its *kind* of
filesystem object depends on how the tree was created. `tests/.../Support/RepoTree.cs` is the one
resolver now, matching `CLAUDE.md` beside `scripts\`.

**AND A HOOK'S CHILDREN INHERIT `GIT_*`, WHICH IS HOW THE GATE'S OWN TESTS SET `core.bare = true` ON
THE REAL REPO.** Git exports `GIT_DIR` to every hook, plus `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `GIT_PREFIX` and
`GIT_QUARANTINE_PATH` during a push, and a child `git` obeys them over its own working directory —
so `PrePushGateTests`' fixture-building `git init` ran against the repository being pushed, and with
`GIT_DIR` set and no work tree `git init` marks it **bare**. Every later work-tree operation then
answered `fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree`. Repaired with `git config core.bare
false`, `git fsck` clean. **Any test that shells out to `git` must strip `GIT_*` first.** The gate
also stops rather than guessing now: while that config was broken, the *fixed* script fell back to
its own location, tested `main` and printed PASS — the original defect returning through its own
escape hatch.

**AND THE SAME LEAK REWROTE THE REPO'S IDENTITY, which is the symptom that actually reached a
commit.** `core.bare` was the loud half; the quiet half is that the fixture also ran
`git config user.email` / `user.name` / `commit.gpgsign`, so the real `.git/config` gained a
`[user]` section reading `fixture <fixture@example.invalid>` and a `[commit] gpgsign = false` —
**neither section existed before** — and the next two commits on the branch were authored by
`fixture`. Nothing warns: `git commit` uses whatever identity resolves, and the repo-local value
wins over the global one. **The repair is to UNSET the local keys, not to set a value**: the
identity had always come from `~/.gitconfig`, so writing a guessed name would have pinned the repo
to it for ever. `git config --unset user.name`, `--unset user.email`, `--unset commit.gpgsign`,
then `git rebase <base> --exec "git commit --amend --no-edit --reset-author"` over the affected
range. Check with `git config --show-origin --get user.name` — the *origin* is the answer, not the
value.

So one inherited `GIT_DIR` produced three distinct kinds of damage — a bare repo, a wrong author,
and silently disabled commit signing — and only the first announced itself. **When a stray process
has written to a repo's config, diff the whole file against what it should contain rather than
fixing the symptom you noticed.**

**A PLAIN `dotnet test` WAS GREEN THROUGH ALL OF THAT.** 1640 passing locally, 6 failing inside the
hook, and the two config-corruption rounds invisible either way. Only a real `git push` from a
worktree found any of it — the same rule this file states for LabVIEW tools, applied to our own
tooling: **a fix verified only by the test written alongside it is not verified.**

**AND `dotnet` ON THIS STATION NEEDS ITS PATH CHECKED BEFORE BLAMING ANYTHING ELSE.**
`C:\Program Files\dotnet` holds a RUNTIME with no `sdk` directory and comes FIRST on `PATH`, while the
SDK (8.0.424) is per-user in `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet`. A bare `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` therefore
dies with `No .NET SDKs were found` and a download link — for what is purely PATH order, and it
aborted a push that way. The gate now finds a `dotnet` with an `sdk\` directory beside it, uses that
one and says which; for a shell of your own, `$env:PATH = "$env:USERPROFILE\.dotnet;$env:PATH"`.
`.githooks/README.md` has every measurement above.

**NEVER RUN `dotnet msbuild -t:Compile` HERE, and do not build to a redirected output path either.**
Both look like harmless ways to type-check around that exe lock, and both silently produce a DLL
**with no embedded resources** — then mark it up to date, so the next full `build.ps1` inherits it.
Measured twice on 2026-09-07: 1 627 648 bytes against 2 592 768, and `build.ps1` answering
`12 document(s) wrong - the build is not what you think it is.` Every served document and three
embedded agent definitions were missing, which is 40-odd failing tests pointing everywhere except
at the cause. `-t:Compile` skips the resource-preparation targets; a redirected
`BaseIntermediateOutputPath` collides with the generated protobuf and `AssemblyInfo`.

**A RELEASE TAG IS `vX.Y.Z`, lower-case, three decimal components — and `scripts/Assert-ReleaseTag.ps1`
is the first step of the release workflow so a bad one publishes nothing.** Check a tag *before*
pushing it: `-Tag v1.4.0` costs a second and the refusal names the mistake, the intended tag and the
retag commands. The rule exists because the tags did not agree: measured 2026-09-11, five of nine
were upper-case `V` — which git treats as a *different ref* and the `v*` trigger therefore ignores
outright — and `v10.4` had two components, which additionally sorts ABOVE every three-part tag in
`git tag --sort=-v:refname`, so for ten days the newest-looking tag in the list was neither the
newest release nor a valid version.

**AND THE TAG IS THE ONLY THING THAT NAMES A BUILD, so do not hand-cut a release.** `<Version>` in
the csproj is `0.0.0` — the marker for "not from the workflow" — and only `dotnet publish
-p:Version=` stamps a real one. Until 2026-09-11 nothing set it at all, so every release ever
published carried the SDK default `1.0.0` and was indistinguishable from a local debug build:
identifying an install meant hashing 800 files. The commit SHA had been embedded the whole time
(the SDK appends `SourceRevisionId` to `InformationalVersion`), which is the lesson worth keeping —
**a value that exists but is not reported is not an answer**, the same shape as an embedded document
nothing serves. It is now reported by `--version`, by `lvai_status` and by `pylv_status`, that last
one because it is the only one that answers with no LabVIEW running.

**BUT `serverCommit` IS THE HEAD AT BUILD TIME, so on a DEV build it names the PARENT of the change
you are testing.** The ordinary loop is edit, build, test, *then* commit - so the binary contains the
fix while the id names the commit before it. Measured 2026-09-18 on acceptance: `lvai_status` said
`0.0.0-dev (15feae1e)` for a DLL that demonstrably carried the fix committed as `7c2d2f0`. **On a dev
build, ask the DLL** - one `grep -a` for a string only the new code has - and compare the DLL's
`LastWriteTime` against the server process's `StartTime` to see whether the running process loaded
it. **A tool DESCRIPTION is no better**: the same session served the OLD description text out of the
deferred-tool catalogue while the DLL held the new one and every server process post-dated it. Both
are one step removed from the code; the behaviour and the binary are not.
`docs/release-versioning.md` §5a.

**NEVER PUBLISH `build.ps1`'s OUTPUT — and that is not a style rule, it happened five times.**
Measured 2026-09-11 off the GitHub API: `V1.1.5`, `V1.2.0`, `V1.2.2`, `V1.2.5` and `V1.2.8` carry a
`labview-mcp.zip` uploaded by a PERSON, 19-21 MB against CI's 62 MB, and V1.2.8's asset opened is a
zip of `src\LabVIEWMCP\bin\Debug\net8.0` — exe and 46 loose DLLs at the archive ROOT, no
`.claude-plugin\plugin.json`, no `.mcp.json`, no `agents\`, a framework-dependent apphost that does
not start without the .NET 8 runtime, and a pylabview bundle off a workstation's **Python 3.14**,
the version `release.yml` pins away from because it emits SyntaxWarnings from `LVheap.py` on every
import. For four days `/releases/latest/download/labview-mcp.zip` served one of those to every
plugin install, which is what the README's "problem with the installer" banner was describing.
`scripts/Assert-PublishedRelease.ps1` rejects one now, run as `release.yml`'s **last step** against
the release it just cut, and **daily** by `.github/workflows/verify-release.yml` — daily because an
asset can be swapped long after any workflow ran, and because the five hand-cut releases had no
`release.yml` run at all, so no final step could have caught them.

**DO NOT ADD A `release:` TRIGGER TO THAT WORKFLOW — it was there, and it failed 5 of 5.** Measured
2026-09-11 over v1.5.0 and v1.5.1: a release here is created in the GitHub UI, which creates the tag,
which starts `release.yml` by push — so the release exists **with zero assets** about two seconds
before the publishing run begins and 3-5 minutes before it attaches anything, and `3 x 60 s` of
retrying cannot cover that. It was also redundant, because `release.yml`'s own final step was green
on both releases while the event-triggered runs failed beside it; and one publish fires `created`,
`published` *and* `released`, so five event types produced three concurrent racing runs per release.
**A guard placed on an event that fires before the thing it checks exists measures the clock, not
the artefact.**

**The process lesson generalises past releases: A PIPELINE GUARANTEE IS NOT A PROPERTY OF THE
ARTEFACT.** "There is one build and one packaging path" was true of the workflow and said nothing
about what sat on the Releases page. Reading `uploader.login` off the API settled in one call what
reasoning about the pipeline had hidden for four days. **Ask the artefact, not the process that is
supposed to have made it** — the same rule as "ask the file, not the session".

**AND THERE ARE TWO LISTS OF WHAT SHIPS.** The `.csproj` globs decide a local build's output; the
staging step in `release.yml` decides the archive. `docs\` and `scripts\` are globbed in both, so a
new file reaches both by itself — everything named individually (`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.claude\settings.json`) must be added TWICE. `README.md` was in only one, so a plugin install was
the one route without it while this file asserted the opposite.

**THE PLUGIN AND THE RELEASE ZIP ARE THE SAME BYTES — stop looking for a packaging difference.**
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` declares the plugin as an `archive` source pointing at
`releases/latest/download/labview-mcp.zip`, so a store install IS that asset unpacked: one build,
one packaging path. Measured over one tag, 732 files, every SHA-256 equal, the pylabview bundle
byte-for-byte identical. A reported behaviour difference is **version skew**, and the usual cause is
that a marketplace catalogue does not refresh itself — one 13 days stale was serving a copy three
releases behind. `claude plugin marketplace update` then `claude plugin update`. The one real
asymmetry is extraction: Explorer's "Extract All" propagates Mark-of-the-Web onto the bundled
`python.exe`, so extract with `tar -xf`.

**QUALIFIED THE SAME DAY IT WAS WRITTEN: that holds for an asset the WORKFLOW produced, and five
were not** — see the hand-cut releases above. Both installs behind the 732-file measurement came
from bot-uploaded tags (v1.3.0 and v1.0.7), which was luck rather than method. So the order is:
check the **uploader and the tag** first, and only then reach for a byte comparison.

**The recovery is `rm -rf src/LabVIEWMCP/obj src/LabVIEWMCP/bin tests/LabVIEWMCP.Tests/obj
tests/LabVIEWMCP.Tests/bin` and a normal build.** If you want a type-check while the server holds
the lock, accept the two copy errors at the end of a normal build — the compile has already
happened by then, and `0 Error(s)` above them is the answer. **And read `build.ps1`'s whole tail,
not a grep for `error`**: its byte-identity check is the only thing that catches this, and it
reports as `MISMATCH`, not as an error.
