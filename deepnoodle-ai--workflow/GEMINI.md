# Workflow Library

Go library for defining and executing multi-step processes as directed graphs.
Module: `github.com/deepnoodle-ai/workflow`

Read `llms.txt` for the full API reference. The friendly tour lives in
`documentation/` and `README.md`.

## Scope

This is a **pure execution engine**. It runs workflows in-process and lets
consumers plug in everything else.

**Does**: Define workflows as step graphs. Execute steps (activities). Branch
and join execution paths. Retry with backoff. Catch and route errors. Checkpoint
execution state. Resume from checkpoints. Suspend on signals, wall-clock sleeps,
and operator pauses. Track step progress. Evaluate edge conditions and `${...}`
parameter templates via a bundled expression engine
(`github.com/deepnoodle-ai/expr`).

**Does not**: Store workflows, checkpoints, or progress. Queue or schedule work.
Manage distributed workers or leases. Provide a database, API, or UI.

Storage is the consumer's problem. The library defines interfaces
(`Checkpointer`, `StepProgressStore`, `ActivityLogger`, `SignalStore`,
`WorkflowRegistry`) and the consumer plugs in whatever they like (Postgres,
Redis, S3, etc.). The built-in `FileCheckpointer` and `MemoryCheckpointer` are
for development and testing.

## How Branch Execution Works

A workflow starts with a single "main" branch executing from the start step.
Each branch runs in its own goroutine and progresses step-by-step through the
graph. When a step has multiple matching edges, the branch **forks**: the
engine creates new child branches, each running in its own goroutine. When
branches fork, each child receives a **deep copy** of the parent's state —
after that point, branches are fully independent with no shared mutable state.

The orchestrator (`execution.go`) coordinates branches through a channel-based
snapshot loop:
1. Branches send snapshot messages to a shared channel as they complete steps
2. The orchestrator processes snapshots sequentially on the main goroutine
3. This handles branching (spawn new branches), joining (wait for branches to
   converge), checkpointing, and failure propagation
4. The loop exits when no active branches remain

Join steps (`JoinConfig`) block a branch until specified branches complete, then
merge state from the completed branches into the waiting branch via
`BranchMappings`.

## Concurrency Model

- **No shared mutable state between branches.** Copy-on-branch eliminates races.
- **Single orchestrator goroutine** processes all branch snapshots sequentially.
  This avoids concurrent mutation of `ExecutionState` from the orchestration side.
- **`ExecutionState` is mutex-protected** (`sync.RWMutex`) because both the
  orchestrator and activity execution goroutines access it (e.g., checkpointing
  after activity completion happens under lock in `executeActivity`).
- **Step progress dispatch is fire-and-forget.** Store calls run in detached
  goroutines. Errors are logged, never block the workflow.
- **Heartbeat runs in a separate goroutine** and cancels the execution context
  on failure — cooperative shutdown via standard `context.Context` cancellation.

## Commands

`make test` runs the test suite. `make test-all` also runs `go vet`.
`make cover` produces a coverage report.

## Packages and modules

The repository is a single Go module (`github.com/deepnoodle-ai/workflow`)
with a single external dependency: `github.com/deepnoodle-ai/expr`.
Everything ships from this one module, including the CLI and the
example programs. The whole tree must compile with only the stdlib +
expr.

- Root (`workflow`) — the engine: definition, execution, checkpointing,
  errors, and the default expression-language compiler. `DefaultScriptCompiler()`
  wraps `github.com/deepnoodle-ai/expr` and is used automatically when no
  custom compiler is provided via `WithScriptCompiler()`. Consumers that want a
  different engine (Risor, expr-lang, CEL, etc.) implement `script.Compiler`
  themselves and pass it explicitly.
- `cmd/workflow/` — the CLI. Loads workflows from JSON files via
  `encoding/json` and runs them with the built-in activity registry.
- `examples/` — runnable example programs. Compile against the same
  module, so adding an example must not introduce any new dependency.
- `documentation/` — user guides covering activities, branching, checkpointing,
  child workflows, edge matching, error handling, expressions, runner usage,
  signals/sleep/pause, state management, and testing.

Packages inside the root module:

- `activities/` — stable built-in activities (print, time, json, random, fail).
- `activities/contrib/` — less-stable activities (shell, file).
- `activities/httpx/` — HTTP activity (separate subpackage due to net/http).
- `script/` — engine-neutral interfaces (`Compiler`, `Script`, `Value`),
  the `${…}` template parser, and shared helpers (`IsTruthyValue`,
  `EachValue`) used by custom compiler adapters.
- `internal/require/` — a tiny stdlib-only replacement for testify/require
  so tests don't drag in an external assertion library.
- `workflowtest/` — test helpers (Run, MockActivity, MemoryCheckpointer).

Experimental submodules (separate `go.mod`, not imported by the root module):

- `experimental/worker/` — queue-backed durable worker (claim loop, heartbeat,
  reaper, credit reconciler). Defines the `QueueStore` and `HandlerStores`
  interfaces. `Claim` carries `WorkerID`, `ProjectID`, `ParentRunID`,
  `InitiatedBy`, and `Metadata`. Handlers receive a `*HandlerContext` carrying
  the `Claim` plus optional pre-fenced `Checkpointer`, `StepProgressStore`,
  `ActivityLogger`, and `SignalStore` — only `Checkpointer` is lease-fenced;
  the others accept `*Claim` for API symmetry. `SignalStore` is shared across
  claims and lives on `Config`, not the factory. Outbox row IDs (triggers,
  webhooks) are generated worker-side via `Config.IDGenerator`.
- `experimental/worker/runquery/` — backend-neutral run query package
  (stdlib-only) that holds `Run`, `RunFilter`, `RunCursor`, `ErrRunNotFound`,
  `ErrCannotDeleteRunning`, and the `Store` interface. Dashboards depend on
  this package instead of importing a specific store implementation.
- `experimental/store/postgres/` — pgx-backed persistence implementing
  `Checkpointer`, `StepProgressStore`, `ActivityLogger`, `CreditStore`,
  `QueueStore`, and `runquery.Store` (`GetRun`, `ListRuns` with keyset
  pagination + metadata JSONB containment, `CountRuns`, `DeleteRun`).
  `DeleteRun` is a single atomic statement that refuses running runs.
  Schema namespace is configurable via `WithSchema(...)`; defaults to
  `"public"`. `Migrate` issues `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` and templates
  `schema.sql` with the chosen schema. Schema names are validated as simple
  SQL identifiers. The migration carries forward v0.0.3 single-tenant rows
  by rewriting empty-string `org_id`/`initiated_by` to `NULL`.
- `experimental/store/sqlite/` — `database/sql`-backed persistence with the
  same interface surface. Single-writer, suitable for dev/testing and
  single-process deployments. No schema namespacing escape hatch — consumers
  who need coexistence should hand the library a dedicated `*sql.DB`.

## Conventions

- **Tests**: `internal/require` (local testify shim). Internal tests
  (`package workflow`), except `workflowtest/` which uses
  `package workflowtest_test`.
- **Interfaces**: Small (one method when possible). Never modify exported
  interfaces — use optional side interfaces (see `ProgressReporter` pattern).
- **Errors**: Sentinels with `errors.Is`. Structured errors via `WorkflowError`.
- **New features**: Additive only. The `NewExecution()` and `Execute()` signatures
  are frozen. New behavior is added through functional options or the `Runner`.
- **Compose, don't inherit.** Each piece works standalone. Runner isn't required.

## Things to Know

- The first step in the Steps slice is the start step.
- `ErrFenceViolation` bypasses retry and catch — non-retryable by design.
- `buildResult` classifies interrupted executions (context canceled mid-run)
  as failed, even if `SetFinished()` was never called.
