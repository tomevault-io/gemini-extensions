Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

This file is a **map**, not the manual. The technical content lives in `docs/` and the per-crate `README.md`s; this file points at the right page for whatever you're touching, plus the rules of engagement that apply across the whole repo.

Keep it that way when you edit it. A table row here is a one-line "what this covers" plus the link - if you find yourself writing a spec into a cell, the spec belongs on the linked page instead.

## Project mission

Two coordinated tracks under one repo (`-re` = reverse-engineering, in both senses):

1. **Asset preservation + format docs.** Extract every asset on the disc, document every format with Ghidra-traced provenance, build round-trip parsers.
2. **Engine reimplementation.** From-scratch Rust port - render via wgpu, audio via the XA + VAB decoders, optional WASM target. End-user model: ship the engine, user supplies the disc image, engine extracts and runs.

The public framing is **a playable port and modding hub standing on Ghidra-traced reverse engineering** - fresh Rust from format docs + decompiled-C reference (ScummVM / OpenRCT2 model), not a decompilation project and not a static recompilation of `SCUS_942.54`. Don't call it "clean-room" in committed prose (the same people read the dumps and write the Rust); the enforced boundary is in [`docs/subsystems/engine.md`](docs/subsystems/engine.md).

**"Port" does not mean 1:1.** Retail behaviour is the measured ground truth - the traced dumps and parity oracles pin it exactly, and a retail-faithful mode stays available and testable - but the port is not bound by it. New features, mechanics, rendering and audio are in scope; enhancements ship enabled by default where they are clearly the better experience, with retail one toggle away.

The enhancement layer today: dynamic lighting (`--dynamic-lighting`, pixel-identical when off), the camera-occlusion fade (see-through walls around the player, default-on in `play-window`, `--no-occlusion-fade` / `F4` disables), precise free-angle movement (`options::precise_movement`), the debug orbit camera, and VR - all toggles that leave the faithful mode bit-identical when off. Per-knob current defaults live in [`docs/subsystems/engine.md`](docs/subsystems/engine.md#fidelity-and-enhancements); a knob still defaulting to retail marks an enhanced side that is maturing, not a policy of restraint.

The render path splits in two, and the halves point opposite ways. **Shading defaults to retail**: the game's textured / colour mesh paths draw the TMD's baked colour word through the GTE depth cue and apply no light source at all. **Rasterisation defaults to clean**: `Renderer::set_psx_mode` is opt-in and gates vertex jitter + 15-bit dither only. Affine UVs are not gated - they are unconditional, and they are the faithful behaviour.

The shading half now holds on **both** hosts. The synthetic Lambert survives in exactly two viewer aids - `MESH_SHADER_SRC` (the asset-viewer's bare-geometry preview) and the site's deliberately-lit bestiary preview - neither of which is a claim about retail. `site/js/webgl-shaders.js` once applied that Lambert on *both* its paths on every 3D page; both are retail now, the page uploads per-vertex packet colour, and no light uniform remains. The trap that kept it alive: an unbound colour attribute defaults to white, and white is `texel * 255/128`, so a missing colour stream reads as "too bright", not as "unlit". Tracked in [`docs/tooling/host-drift.md`](docs/tooling/host-drift.md).

Modding (`crates/patcher`) and translation are designed, shipped tracks, not side-effects - and what the patcher proves out against retail (randomizer logic, softlock fixes, tuning sliders) is expected to graduate into engine toggles. What the project still is *not*: a static recompile, and never a build that silently loses the retail-faithful mode.

**Sony IP (executable, ROM contents, asset bytes) is NEVER committed.** `extracted/` is gitignored, disc-dependent tests skip when `LEGAIA_DISC_BIN` is unset, no decompressed Sony bytes (text strings, sample data, decompiled-C dumps with literal data) get checked in. CI runs without disc data.

## Repository map

The committed docs are organised topic-first under `docs/` - public-facing technical reference, no progress tracker / session log / status tables. Operational state lives in git log + the agent-only memory directory at `~/.claude/projects/-home-mikunpc-Documents-repos-legend-of-legaia-re/memory/`.

### Top level

- [`README.md`](README.md) - public project overview, build instructions, license.
- [`docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md) - elevator pitch + how the layers stack from disc to sub-asset.
- [`docs/guides/`](docs/guides/getting-started.md) - task-oriented user guides: getting-started, extracting-assets, playing-and-viewing, modding-and-translation.

### Formats - [`docs/formats/`](docs/formats/overview.md)

Per-format byte-level specs with Ghidra-traced provenance. Read the relevant page before writing a parser; don't guess from the data.

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`overview.md`](docs/formats/overview.md) | Index page; confidence levels (Confirmed / Inferred / Unknown); format families. |
| **Disc + container layer** | |
| [`disc.md`](docs/formats/disc.md) | PSX Mode2/2352 layout, ISO9660 walk. |
| [`prot.md`](docs/formats/prot.md) | PROT.DAT TOC, 1233 entries (`start_lba = toc[p+2]`, `size_sectors = toc[p+3] - toc[p+2]` - the gap to the next entry). |
| [`dmy.md`](docs/formats/dmy.md) | DMY.DAT - dev-fixture data, no real game content. |
| [`cdname.md`](docs/formats/cdname.md) | CDNAME.TXT name map (`#define name N` marks block start, names inherit forward). |
| **Compression + dispatch** | |
| [`lzs.md`](docs/formats/lzs.md) | Legaia LZS (4 KB ring buffer initialised to zeros - output magic-check is required). |
| [`asset-type.md`](docs/formats/asset-type.md) | 8-bit type byte → handler dispatch (TIM=0, TMD=2, MES=4, ANM=6, …). |
| [`asset-descriptor.md`](docs/formats/asset-descriptor.md) | Descriptor layout consumed by the asset dispatcher. |
| [`data-field.md`](docs/formats/data-field.md) | DATA_FIELD streaming format. |
| **Pack + bundle formats** (the first three are distinct layouts - don't confuse their header math) | |
| [`pack.md`](docs/formats/pack.md) | `asset::pack` inside DATA_FIELD chunks. `u32 count` then `u32 word_offsets[count]`. |
| [`tim-pack.md`](docs/formats/tim-pack.md) | `prot::timpack` - not a container of its own, but the reader for an `asset::pack` sitting behind a `TIM_LIST` chunk header. `byte_offset = word_index*4 + 4`, and the `marker == 0x01` it keys on is that header's type byte. |
| [`field-pack.md`](docs/formats/field-pack.md) | **Not a format.** The "magic" `0x01059B84` is a DATA_FIELD chunk header `(TIM_LIST << 24) \| payload_len` wrapping an `asset::pack` of one scene's TIMs, at raw-TOC `+4` of its CDNAME block; the page records how the format reading arose and what consumes the entry. |
| [`battle-data-pack.md`](docs/formats/battle-data-pack.md) | Player battle files `data\battle\PLAYER1..4` (extraction 863..866; Vahn/Noa/Gala/Terra): header + LZS `record[0]` + equip-slot descriptor table + per-slot mesh/texture streams. Also the in-battle **pose** source for the assembled meshes - **not** PROT 1203. NB the doc records why the old "16 MB container at 0865" reading was wrong. |
| [`place-names.md`](docs/formats/place-names.md) | The **three** carriers one place name has, each driving one display: the SCUS quick-travel cells, the 29-record world-map label table trailing every kingdom MAN (`DAT_80073EE0`), and each scene MAN's section-2 banner name (`_DAT_801C6EA0`). Parser `legaia_asset::place_names`. |
| [`npc-palette.md`](docs/formats/npc-palette.md) | Row-479 NPC CLUTs (`fb_x=0..256, fb_y=479`) - plain PSX TIMs in scene PROT entries. The doc covers the merge-zeros upload semantics that let several scene-pack TIMs share the row. |
| [`effect.md`](docs/formats/effect.md) | Magic `0x02018B0C` bundle + the `efect.dat` runtime 2-pack (extraction 0873): sprite anims + effect scripts. Carries the verified `befect_data` map (`etim`/`etmd`/`vdf`/`efect` = extraction 0870..0873). |
| [`summon-readef.md`](docs/formats/summon-readef.md) | `summon.dat` / `readef.DAT` battle side-band streaming slots (extraction PROT 893 / 894): per-special-attack CLUT rows, 4bpp texture pages, summon-creature actor records, player art-anim "ME" archives. Doc carries the action-id → slot mapping. Parser `legaia_asset::summon_readef`. |
| **Sub-assets** | |
| [`tim.md`](docs/formats/tim.md) | PSX TIM. |
| [`tmd.md`](docs/formats/tmd.md) | Legaia TMD variant - magic `0x80000002`, custom primitive grouping (8-byte group header + `count × ilen*4` body), per-mode descriptor table at `DAT_8007326c`. |
| [`vab.md`](docs/formats/vab.md) | VAB sound bank. |
| [`seq.md`](docs/formats/seq.md) | PsyQ-derived SEQ sequence (`pQES` magic). Legaia's header + meta-event encoding diverge - see the cross-cutting bullet below. Parser `crates/seq`. |
| [`xa.md`](docs/formats/xa.md) | CD-XA Mode 2 Form 2 audio sectors (`XA1.XA`…) carrying cutscene voice / streamed audio: 2352-byte raw layout, 18 sound groups × 128 B per sector. Decoder `crates/xa`. |
| [`mes.md`](docs/formats/mes.md) | MES dialog containers (Compact + Records variants). |
| [`anm.md`](docs/formats/anm.md) | ANM animation pack (player / field actors). Two frame-stream families the doc keeps apart: the **party locomotion bundle** (PROT 0874 §1) and the **per-scene NPC/scene-actor bundle** (each scene's first PROT slot). Per-(bone,frame) 8-byte entry. Parser `legaia_asset::player_anm`. |
| [`monster-animation.md`](docs/formats/monster-animation.md) | Enemy battle animation: per-object rigid-transform keyframes inside the monster archive (PROT 867). Per-action packed stream at entry `+0x8c`; the entry's first byte is an action **tag**, not an index - the doc tabulates the tag space. Decoder `FUN_8004998c`. |
| [`character-mesh.md`](docs/formats/character-mesh.md) | Player-character meshes. Field form = PROT 0874 §0 (parser `legaia_asset::character_pack`). Battle form is **assembled per character** from the player battle files' equipment-id sections, not loaded whole (port `legaia_asset::battle_char_assembly`); PROT 1204 is the Baka Fighter / default-equipment sibling pack. Doc has the splice chain + where each rest pose comes from. |
| [`mdt.md`](docs/formats/mdt.md) | Move table (Tactical Arts). |
| [`save-icon.md`](docs/formats/save-icon.md) | Save-slot portrait sheet in the menu overlay (PROT 899 `0x1F908`): sixteen 16x16 tiles row-interleaved across a 256x16 strip, one 16-colour palette per tile. Tile N = the memory-card icon for save N+1 (`FUN_801E1934`); tile 15 is blank padding nothing selects. Parser `legaia_asset::save_icon`. |
| [`window-script.md`](docs/formats/window-script.md) | The window-script VM's bytecode programs (fixed 4-byte `[opcode][window id][operand]` instructions): a program table resident in the menu overlay's own data segment (PROT 0899), driving the shop / menu window choreography. Parser + `jal`-site scanner `legaia_asset::widget_script`. |
| [`move-power.md`](docs/formats/move-power.md) | Battle-action per-move power + behaviour table (26-byte stride, runtime VA `0x801F4F5C`, PROT 0898 file `0x26744`), indexed by `map[actor+0x1df]`. Whole record decoded in the doc. Move-id space = the spell-table id space. Parser `legaia_asset::move_power`. |
| [`battle-attack-camera-table.md`](docs/formats/battle-attack-camera-table.md) | Per-art attack-camera tracks (`0x801F4E10`, PROT 0898 file `0x265F8`): 20 rows x 2 signed halfwords, addressed `row*4 + phase_cursor*2`. The data `FUN_801D71B8`'s per-art arms fold into the swing framing. Parser `legaia_asset::battle_attack_camera_table`. |
| [`art-data.md`](docs/formats/art-data.md) | Art records: per-character ActionConstants, command sequences, power-byte encoding, Miracle/Super Art trigger tables. PROT entry `0x05C4`. |
| [`spell-table.md`](docs/formats/spell-table.md) | Static `SCUS_942.54` spell table: `DAT_800754C8` stats / `DAT_800754D0` name pointers, 12-byte stride. Player Seru-magic block `0x81..=0x8b`; mirror at `engine-core::retail_magic`. Doc covers how an enemy's cast resolves into the same id space. Parser `legaia_asset::spell_names`. |
| [`item-table.md`](docs/formats/item-table.md) | Static `SCUS_942.54` item-name table `PTR_DAT_8007436C[id*3]` (256 ids, 12-byte stride, `+0`=name pointer). The id space a monster record's `drop_item` indexes; parser `legaia_asset::item_names`. |
| [`item-effect-table.md`](docs/formats/item-effect-table.md) | Static `SCUS_942.54` item-effect descriptor table `DAT_800752C0` (130 records, 4-byte stride): effect class, tier, usability flags. **Literal restore amounts are not here** - they're overlay-resident. Parser `legaia_asset::item_effect`. |
| [`equipment-table.md`](docs/formats/equipment-table.md) | Static `SCUS_942.54` equipment stat-bonus table `DAT_80074F68` (8-byte stride): per-equip attack/defence/agility bonuses, equip-character mask, slot type, Ra-Seru flag. Parser `legaia_asset::equip_stats`. |
| [`accessory-passive-table.md`](docs/formats/accessory-passive-table.md) | Accessory ("Goods") passive effects over a 64-slot index space → bit `index` in the per-character ability bitfield `char+0xF4`. Name/description/scope table at `0x8007625C`. Quest items alias their purchasable twins. Parser `legaia_asset::accessory_passive`; engine side `engine-core::accessory_passives`. |
| [`steal-table.md`](docs/formats/steal-table.md) | Static `SCUS_942.54` per-monster steal table `DAT_80077828 + monster_id*2` (1-based id, 2-byte stride). **Field order is `[chance, item]`** - the reverse of the drop fields in the monster record, and it is NOT in the PROT 867 record at all. Parser `legaia_asset::steal_table`. |
| [`new-game-table.md`](docs/formats/new-game-table.md) | Static `SCUS_942.54` new-game starting-party template at `0x80078C4C` (4 records, 26-byte stride). Seeds the `0x80084708 + n*0x414` live records; opening scene = `town01`. Parser `legaia_asset::new_game`. |
| [`save-record.md`](docs/formats/save-record.md) | The runtime per-character record the new-game template seeds: `0x414` bytes, 4 contiguous at `0x80084708 + slot*0x414`; display name at `+0x2A7`. Typed accessors + round-trip in `legaia_save`. |
| [`encounter.md`](docs/formats/encounter.md) | Encounter record installed at `actor[+0x94]`: `[3 reserved][count: u8][monster_ids: u8[count]]`. Reader at `FUN_801DA51C` body `0x801DA620..0x801DA678`. Also the MAN section-3 camera-region table and the scratchpad window `0x1F8003E8..EB` those records side-write - the camera's **visible tile window**, which field-VM op `0x46` sets and the render library's cell emitters read. |
| [`man-relocation.md`](docs/formats/man-relocation.md) | Variable-length editing of a decompressed MAN - resizing a record means fixing the partition tables, `u24_at_28`, intra-record jump deltas and the external descriptor size word, all of which the doc enumerates. Engine `legaia_asset::man_edit`; powers the door randomizer and the localization dialog rewriter. |
| [`str-fmv-table.md`](docs/formats/str-fmv-table.md) | FMV dispatch table at `0x801D0A6C` (23 × 32-byte slots; nine retail `fmv_id 0..=8` = every disc movie, `MV3.STR` split by frame range; parser `legaia_asset::fmv_dispatch`). Per-scene trigger assignment is disc-sourced, not in the table - literal `fmv_id` operands in the scene MAN scripts. |
| [`scene-bundles.md`](docs/formats/scene-bundles.md) | Scene-asset bundle layout per game mode. Retail bounds the descriptor count nowhere - the anchor is descriptor 0 at `8 + count*8`, and two scenes (`bubu1`, `edbubu`) ship a `count = 5` table. The header's `+0x04` word is the sum of the descriptors' decompressed sizes and is never read. |
| [`scene-v12-table.md`](docs/formats/scene-v12-table.md) | Per-scene `.PCH` walk-on trigger sidecar: runtime-fixup header + inline-record table, exactly one `0x800` sector in all 97 cases. The event-script prescript is the **next PROT entry**, not a field at `+0x800` - that reading was the over-reading entry size appending the neighbour. |
| [`field-map.md`](docs/formats/field-map.md) | Per-scene `DATA\FIELD\<scene>.MAP` - the fixed `0x12000`-byte slot 0 of every scene block (101 entries). Four regions summing to the footprint exactly; detected on the trigger block's sub-table chain. Per-field semantics in [`field-locomotion.md`](docs/subsystems/field-locomotion.md). |
| [`world-map-overlay.md`](docs/formats/world-map-overlay.md) | Slot 4 of each kingdom bundle (PROT 0086 / 0245 / 0392, type byte `0x05`): the world-map scene's **ANM animation bank**, the same clip container every field scene carries - 8-byte entries of three 12-bit translations + three 8-bit rotations, frame-major, read by the clip selector `FUN_800204F8` and the animated renderer `FUN_8001B964`. The "GTE vertex pool + cluster-A command stream" and "coastline wireframe" readings are both **falsified** - see the doc before re-opening either. |
| [`pochi.md`](docs/formats/pochi.md) | "Pochi-fill" placeholder slots - reserved-but-unused dev fillers. Every one is exactly **one 2048-byte sector** of fill and none carries a parseable TIM. The old "stale mastering scratch that parses as a valid TIM" reading is **falsified**: the pages that corrupted a ground atlas came from the `scene_tmd_stream` entry *after* the pochi slot, reached through the over-reading entry-size expression since corrected in `prot.md`. |
| [`mips-overlay.md`](docs/formats/mips-overlay.md) | Per-PROT MIPS-code-likelihood detection. |
| [`overlay-ptr-table.md`](docs/formats/overlay-ptr-table.md) | Sister of `mips-overlay`. |
| **Auxiliary** | |
| [`sfx-table.md`](docs/formats/sfx-table.md) | Static `SCUS_942.54` sound-effect descriptor table `DAT_8006F198 + id*8` (8-byte stride, 100 entries `0x00..=0x63`): program/VAG, ADSR base, voice count, and the `+4` **category** that selects the cue's VAB slot (0 = PROT 0868, 2 = 0869, 6 = 0876, 11 = 0889; slots 1/3 hold variable banks). Ids `>= 0x200` come from a runtime bank instead. Parser `legaia_asset::sfx_table`. |
| [`bse-dat.md`](docs/formats/bse-dat.md) | `bse.dat` = the **battle** occupant of the runtime SFX descriptor bank (cue ids `>= 0x200`), loaded per battle from battle init `FUN_800513F0` - not at boot. Row index = `cue id - 0x200`; the columns are the `sfx-table.md` columns, and `+4` (category / VAB slot) is rewritten per cue through `gp+0x678`. Detection class `bse_bank`; parser `legaia_asset::bse_bank`. |
| [`sound-driver.md`](docs/formats/sound-driver.md) | `.dpk` / `.spk` / `.MAP` / `.PCH` (sound-driver outputs in `sound_data` blocks). |
| [`dialog-font.md`](docs/formats/dialog-font.md) | Proportional dialog font: 256-byte width table at SCUS `0x80073F1C`, 38-entry `0xCE` escape table at `0x80074050`, glyph bitmaps in VRAM at `(896, 0)`. |
| [`navmesh.md`](docs/formats/navmesh.md) | Negative finding: the `0x80108EA4` cluster that differs across area-load saves is **not** a 24-byte-stride navmesh - it's a per-scene GPU-primitive scratch buffer the renderer refills on scene entry. Recorded so the path isn't re-walked. |

### Subsystems - [`docs/subsystems/`](docs/subsystems/)

How the runtime engine works.

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`engine.md`](docs/subsystems/engine.md) | From-scratch Rust port architecture and boundaries. |

| [`renderer.md`](docs/subsystems/renderer.md) | TMD renderer at `FUN_8002735c` (60 GTE ops). Scene clip volume: every camera draws the whole scene (`SCENE_FAR`), no distance/frustum culling in the port. |
| [`vr-mode.md`](docs/subsystems/vr-mode.md) | WebXR `immersive-vr` on the static site's 3D pages (world overview / field-scene viewer / play). The flat renderer stays the geometry source - only the framebuffer and the view-projection fork per eye. Doc covers the per-page scale, the retail screen-X mirror the shader depends on, and the two-mode (`VR:`) pages incl. first-person "what Vahn sees". |
| [`audio.md`](docs/subsystems/audio.md) | PsyQ libsnd / libspu stack; SsAPI sequencer; SPU DMA transfer engine. |
| [`script-vm.md`](docs/subsystems/script-vm.md) | Field/event VM at `FUN_801DE840` (overlay-resident, 43 opcodes). Op `0x46` is `VIEW_WINDOW` - it writes the camera's visible-tile window at `0x1F8003E8..EB`, **not** a fog / render config. |
| [`script-vm-menuctrl.md`](docs/subsystems/script-vm-menuctrl.md) | The field VM's longest-tail opcode: `0x4C` `MENU_CTRL`, whose outer high nibble selects 16 sub-dispatchers. Split out of `script-vm.md` for length. |
| [`tile-board.md`](docs/subsystems/tile-board.md) | Tile-board grid mode (puzzle / board minigame), NOT general town locomotion. `width×height` byte cell array (cell `2` = wall) + per-cell tile-actor rendering; installed inline in the field-VM script by op `0x49` (`_DAT_8007b450`); walk SM at `overlay_0897_801ef2b0`. |
| [`field-locomotion.md`](docs/subsystems/field-locomotion.md) | Player free-movement controller `FUN_801d01b0` (field overlay): camera-remapped held pad → direction + facing, per-frame speed, 2-unit stepping with per-axis collision `FUN_801cfe4c` against the per-scene walkability grid at `*(_DAT_1f8003ec)+0x4000` (4 sub-cell wall bits per 128-unit tile). Pinned by runtime write-watchpoint on `player+0x14/0x18`. |
| [`field-ambient-fx.md`](docs/subsystems/field-ambient-fx.md) | Field ambient animation: the bundle type-6 CLUT-walk table (12 carriers, not kingdom-only), the scene-entry ambient move-VM effect tree (MAN P1 effect scripts → `FUN_800252EC` → `FUN_80021B04`), and the mode-3 CLUT-cell HSV cycler `FUN_80019D50` behind jou's pulsating flesh + lightning. Engine `engine-core::world::ambient` + `clut_cell_fx`. |
| [`minigame-fishing.md`](docs/subsystems/minigame-fishing.md) | Fishing minigame: state machine (`FUN_801cf3bc`), tension-gauge reel tug-of-war (`FUN_801d4004`), catch scoring into the persistent counter `0x8008444c`. Also the point-exchange prize counter (parser `legaia_asset::fishing_exchange`) + per-venue rod×cast-band species-spawn tables. |
| [`minigame-slot-machine.md`](docs/subsystems/minigame-slot-machine.md) | Casino slot machine: reel state machine (`FUN_801cf0d8`), dual RNG, **five**-payline payout eval (`FUN_801d13e8` - three straight + two diagonal). The machine is a **3D scene** projected through the GTE via the SCUS wrappers, not 2D sprites - reels are textured cylinders, paylines are projected 3D lines. Doc also covers the bonus round's numeral payout and the cabinet, which is a mesh, not a packet emitter: PROT 1200 descriptor 1, a 2160-byte untextured TMD. Parser `legaia_asset::minigame_slot_scene`. |
| [`minigame-baka-fighter.md`](docs/subsystems/minigame-baka-fighter.md) | Baka Fighter duel minigame: round SM (`FUN_801d3468`), rock-paper-scissors exchange resolver (`FUN_801d3a14`), stat/combo damage, pad-vs-AI move pick; reuses the PROT 1204 battle-form party meshes. |
| [`minigame-dance.md`](docs/subsystems/minigame-dance.md) | Noa dance rhythm minigame: beat-clock state machine (`FUN_801cf470`), timing-window judge (`FUN_801d1960`, accuracy-weighted), step chart at `0x801d509c`, groove gauge `DAT_801d544c` as difficulty/multiplier. |
| [`minigame-muscle-dome.md`](docs/subsystems/minigame-muscle-dome.md) | Muscle Dome arena ladder: match SM (`FUN_801d0748`, phase byte `ctx+6`) in the battle overlay, contest hub (`FUN_801cf870`) in PROT 0977; four direction commands under an AP budget into the actor `+0x1df` queue. Not a card battle. The intermission is a fight boundary, never a turn boundary. |
| [`actor-vm.md`](docs/subsystems/actor-vm.md) | Actor / sprite VM at `FUN_801D6628` (13 opcodes) - the menu overlay's window-widget script interpreter; programs in [`window-script.md`](docs/formats/window-script.md). |
| [`effect-vm.md`](docs/subsystems/effect-vm.md) | Effect-bundle pool; spawn API. |
| [`move-vm.md`](docs/subsystems/move-vm.md) | Move-table opcode VM at `FUN_80023070` (71 ops, JT `0x80010778`); op `0x2F` escapes to overlay extension. |
| [`move-vm-overlay-ext.md`](docs/subsystems/move-vm-overlay-ext.md) | The move VM's `0x2F` `OVERLAY_EXT` opcode and its 61 overlay-resident sub-opcodes (`FUN_801D362C`, dispatch JT `0x801CE868`). Split out of `move-vm.md`. |
| [`motion-vm.md`](docs/subsystems/motion-vm.md) | The two per-actor motion VMs. `FUN_8003774C` - pursue / patrol / face-target (NPC pathing + camera follow). `FUN_80038158` - scripted motion + story-flag writes into `DAT_80085758`; its bytecode is MAN tail-section 1 (`legaia_asset::man_motion`). |
| [`vm-inventory.md`](docs/subsystems/vm-inventory.md) | Census of every VM-shaped subsystem (a bytecode dispatcher or a per-entity state-byte `switch`): what is decoded, ported, and reached by a live caller. "Five VMs" is an orientation, not the full list. |
| [`cutscene.md`](docs/subsystems/cutscene.md) | STR game modes 26/27; MDEC decoder algorithm (VLC → IDCT → BT.601 YCbCr→RGBA); XA audio sync; `play-str` loop. |
| [`battle.md`](docs/subsystems/battle.md) | Battle scene loader; actor pointer table. |
| [`battle-action.md`](docs/subsystems/battle-action.md) | Battle action state machine at `FUN_801E295C`. |
| [`battle-formulas.md`](docs/subsystems/battle-formulas.md) | Damage / MP-cost / accuracy / escape / RNG arithmetic kernels. A physical hit is *Offense Value - Defense Value*; the attacker's ATK is the **un-equipped base plus half of the one equipment slot the command reads** (footwear for High / Low), folded at swing time, never at battle load. Mirror lives at `engine-vm::battle_formulas`. |
| [`cast-module.md`](docs/subsystems/cast-module.md) | Capture-class cast modules (PROT 0935..0966) at slot-B `0x801F69D8`: image shapes, `ctx+0x279` phase machine, clip-staging ABI, seat-0 damage hardcode. Also the three link-time entry tables in PROT 0898 that reach the whole 0903..0966 band, incl. the capture-class one at `0x801CF56C` (arm `i` = PROT `935 + i`), and the frame-matching rule that recovers a module's function extents where the image has no internal `jal`. |
| [`inventory.md`](docs/subsystems/inventory.md) | One 256-slot bag at `0x80085958`, reached only through five SCUS helpers bounded by an **active window** (`gp[+0x2D2..+0x2D6]`, written solely by `FUN_8004313C`) that collapses to one 128-slot half for a lone character - the "split bag". The "72-slot" figure is a cheat's display page, not a bound. |
| [`arts-command-gauge.md`](docs/subsystems/arts-command-gauge.md) | Arts AP gauge + weapon-specialty arm width. Per-command cost at `DAT_801C9360[char][cmd]+0x74` (arm = cmd `0x0C`); the off-class penalty escalates, it is not a flat ×2. **Not a runtime comparison** - the cost is per-(character, weapon) *disc data* copied verbatim into the runtime struct at battle load, which is what makes it a randomizer target. |
| [`world-map.md`](docs/subsystems/world-map.md) | World map controller (`FUN_801E76D4`); top-view debug toggle; camera scroll globals; dev menu renderer (`FUN_801EAD98`); render pipeline + bulk continent terrain emit. Ocean CLUT cycling comes from the kingdom slot-5 CLUT-walk table (`legaia_asset::clut_walk`) - **not** the script-driven CLUT-cell family, which only carries the row-498 park one-shots. |
| [`world-overview-viewer.md`](docs/subsystems/world-overview-viewer.md) | The static-site `/world-overview/` WebGL viewer: AABB layout, distance-cue fog pass (per-Z scalar LUT + per-kingdom haze), MAN `0x7F`-sentinel bulk-terrain resolver, ocean tile + 13-frame CLUT animation, camera anchors. |
| [`save-screen.md`](docs/subsystems/save-screen.md) | Save-slot select + write flow (`FUN_801DC6B4`); lives in menu overlay; entry-context pointer table; the live game-state window at `DAT_80084140` the save block is composed from, and the additive block checksum retail re-sums on load. |
| [`field-menu.md`](docs/subsystems/field-menu.md) | Pause-menu **window descriptor table** (52 records at menu-overlay VA `0x801E4738` / PROT 0899 file `0x15F20`; parser `legaia_asset::menu_windows`), the per-character status/party panel renderer `FUN_801D33D8`, and the **options screen**. Panels are content-only draws - the frame is caller-drawn. Engine port lives in `engine-ui` (`status_screen_draws_for` + siblings, re-exported by `engine-render`) with window rects disc-parsed at boot. |
| [`shop.md`](docs/subsystems/shop.md) | Town shop buy / sell / quantity / confirm flow. UI lives in the **menu overlay** (no separate shop overlay); per-scene stock is inline in the scene MAN's field-VM script, prices from the static item table. Port = `engine-core` shop session. |
| [`inn.md`](docs/subsystems/inn.md) | Inn HP/MP restore. **No inn overlay and no cost table** - each inn is an ordinary field-VM dialogue and the price is a script literal in the scene MAN. Port `engine-core::inn`; cost scanned from the MAN at scene load. |
| [`level-up.md`](docs/subsystems/level-up.md) | Post-battle XP distribution, the per-level stat-gain table, and the banner. Retail applies XP + growth + level bump in overlay `FUN_801E9504`; port `engine-core::levelup::LevelUpTracker`. |

### Tooling - [`docs/tooling/`](docs/tooling/)

| Doc | Covers |
|---|---|
| [`extraction.md`](docs/tooling/extraction.md) | Per-stage CLIs (`disc-extract`, `prot-extract`, `lzs-decode`, `legaia-extract`, …). |
| [`ghidra.md`](docs/tooling/ghidra.md) | Compose-exec invocation, the LUI+ADDIU workaround, full script catalogue. |
| [`overlay-capture.md`](docs/tooling/overlay-capture.md) | Mednafen save-state slicing; one-shot pipeline. |
| [`static-overlay-pipeline.md`](docs/tooling/static-overlay-pipeline.md) | Static complement to the dynamic captures: extract each clean-copy runtime overlay from `PROT.DAT` at its statically-recovered base (`asset overlay …`), identity attached from the PROT entry. Solves VA-aliasing identity structurally + reproducible from the disc; does NOT address runtime values. Committed map `crates/asset/data/static-overlays.toml`. |
| [`mednafen-automation.md`](docs/tooling/mednafen-automation.md) | Save-state diff / bisect / scenario manifest; watchpoint-equivalent observation across `.mc{0..9}` snapshots. |
| [`pcsx-redux-automation.md`](docs/tooling/pcsx-redux-automation.md) | Closed-loop Lua probes layered on PCSX-Redux's breakpoint debugger. Save-state load → arm probes → capture N VSyncs → CSV / snapshot. Catalogue + authoring pattern. |
| [`playthrough-coverage.md`](docs/tooling/playthrough-coverage.md) | Trace-driven documentation worklist: play a scripted opening segment under PCSX-Redux with a breakpoint on every not-yet-understood function, and let the hits pick what to document next. The segment/triage instrument for the probe harness. |
| [`spine-flag-writers-capture.md`](docs/tooling/spine-flag-writers-capture.md) | Runbook to capture the chapter-1 spine story-flag writers that live in un-imported overlays (system flags `0x142` dolk-dungeon-clear, `0x482` Drake mist walls) in one play-forward with all watches armed. |
| [`super-art-queue-capture.md`](docs/tooling/super-art-queue-capture.md) | Runbook + Lua capture pinning the byte-exact Super / Miracle Art action queue (`actor[+0x1DF..+0x1F2]`) each triggered combo expands to; corrects the earlier `ctx[+0x274]` hypothesis. |
| [`port-catalog.md`](docs/tooling/port-catalog.md) | Per-function status catalog: `dumped` (Ghidra) × `documented` (`docs/`) × `ported` (`// PORT: FUN_<addr>` tag in `crates/`) × `ignored` (PsyQ infra in `scripts/ci/port-catalog-ignore.toml`). BFS-from-roots feature views in `scripts/ci/features.toml`. `// REF:` sibling tag for cross-references, and a third class `REPLACED-BY:` for a port no host is owed - it names the Rust mechanism doing the routine's job and leaves the wiring worklist *and its denominator*. `--dashboard` mode emits a single regenerable open-work page. Drift checker `scripts/ci/check-port-tags.py` (warn-only in pre-commit). |
| [`disc-coverage.md`](docs/tooling/disc-coverage.md) | The sibling measurement with the denominator taken from the **disc** instead of from our own citations: byte-exact coverage of each image's code by dumped functions, plus PROT format recognition by bytes. Gate `scripts/ci/disc-coverage.py` (ratchets a committed baseline; skips without disc data). Also emits a bytes-derived dump worklist, and records why a **new** dump reads as a floor regression (attribution lag - the denominator moves first). |
| [`byte-accounting.md`](docs/tooling/byte-accounting.md) | The accounting sibling of `disc-coverage`'s format **recognition**: for one PROT entry, which bytes a parser here actually consumes (`[start, end, owner]` claims, merged) and what shape the rest has (zero pad, BGR555, plausible MIPS, text, ...). `asset account` per entry, `scripts/asset-investigation/byte-account-sweep.py` for the whole TOC; module `legaia_asset::byte_account`. Compressed spans get a nested pass; magic-sweep hits are tagged `scan` so they never inflate the structural figure; for a code image the parser is the dump corpus, with slot-A VA aliasing resolved from the bytes. |
| [`worklist-classification.md`](docs/tooling/worklist-classification.md) | Classifies every `--missing-ports` row by whether it is a portable function entry at all (`REAL` / `INTERIOR` / `SHARED_TAIL` / `DUPLICATE` / `VA_ALIASED` / …), so the worklist reads as work rather than as addresses. |
| [`address-reference-scan.md`](docs/tooling/address-reference-scan.md) | Who references an address, in all five forms at once (literal word, `lui`+`addiu`/`ori`, `jal`, `j`, PC-relative branch) across SCUS, the based overlay images and every raw PROT entry. Turns "I found no caller" into "no reference exists" - the instrument behind the ignore list's `unreferenced` rows. Sweep `scripts/ghidra-analysis/find-address-word-refs.py`; its sibling `find-gp-relative-refs.py` covers the two forms it cannot see (`imm(gp)` and `lui`+load pairs). |
| [`live-audit-triage.md`](docs/tooling/live-audit-triage.md) | Per-anchor verdicts for the `engine-core` / `engine-vm` rows of `port-catalog.py --live-audit` ("undisclosed inert ports"), keyed by address + site so the wiring work is mechanical rather than re-derived. Its `REPLACE` verdict is where a row's `REPLACED-BY:` text comes from. |
| [`stale-not-wired-triage.md`](docs/tooling/stale-not-wired-triage.md) | Sibling section of the same audit: per-row verdicts for "tagged `NOT WIRED` but analysed live", plus the three call-graph shapes that put rows there. |
| [`reach-triage.md`](docs/tooling/reach-triage.md) | Per-address verdicts for `replay-port-coverage.py`'s **live but never entered** set - the runtime gap the static audits are silent about. Four buckets: no ladder drives it, a game gate blocks it, no host reaches it, or it is not playthrough-shaped. Also what a pad-only headless ladder structurally cannot execute (no draw list, no audio device, no `bin/` target). |
| [`call-target-integrity.md`](docs/tooling/call-target-integrity.md) | Why a decoded `jal` target is a property of the bytes and not of the load base, and the one dump window (`overlay_0896` below `0x801CE818`) whose targets are therefore untrustworthy. |
| [`dump-corpus-integrity.md`](docs/tooling/dump-corpus-integrity.md) | The sibling failure: a dump's *printed addresses* are a property of the load base. A filename prefix is not evidence of base correctness - only the header tag is, and even a tagged dump may have gaps. Sweep `check-dump-base-integrity.py`. |
| [`port-provenance.md`](docs/tooling/port-provenance.md) | The same law applied to **function identity**: nothing checked that a `// PORT:` address names the routine the Rust code implements, so a live port wore the casino prize list's address with every gate green. Ranked worklist `scripts/ci/check-port-provenance.py` (warn-only, not in pre-commit); the page also records the signal that was built, measured, and deleted. |
| [`phantom-print-index.md`](docs/tooling/phantom-print-index.md) | The above applied address-by-address to the `0x801C****` / `0x801D****` printed band: per-dump-program re-key deltas, and for every such address the image + VA its bytes really occupy and whether that VA is a function entry. Almost none is. |
| [`recomp-differential.md`](docs/tooling/recomp-differential.md) | Frame-tagged differential oracle vs the static recomp: `scripts/recomp/` TCP probe client + trace capture, `legaia-engine sim-trace` engine emitter, `trace_diff.py` per-channel first-divergence report. Traces are Sony-derived - never committed. |
| [`determinism-replay.md`](docs/tooling/determinism-replay.md) | `j-replay-v1` TOML record/replay format + `legaia-engine record` / `replay` subcommands + disc-free determinism cargo-test. Same input file run twice → bit-identical state-trace bytes; pad transitions captured from `play-window` keyboard handler. |
| [`vrchat-world-export.md`](docs/tooling/vrchat-world-export.md) | `legaia-engine export-glb`: per-scene textured world / NPC / animated-prop `.glb`s + placement manifest for Unity/VRChat world building, `--items` for every equipment item, `--party` for Vahn/Noa/Gala's field forms; Unity kit in `scripts/vrchat-world/`. Output is Sony-derived, gitignored. |
| [`randomizer.md`](docs/tooling/randomizer.md) | Disc patcher for a user-supplied `.bin`. Built on three capabilities: `legaia_lzs::compress` (LZS *encoder*), `legaia_iso::write` (Mode 2/2352 EDC/ECC re-encode), and `legaia_patcher::disc::DiscPatcher` (PROT-entry → LBA same-size in-place edit). The full feature + code-injection reference, incl. where injected routines may live, is on this page. No Sony bytes committed; disc-gated tests. |
| [`releases.md`](docs/tooling/releases.md) | Tagged-release binary pipeline: pushing a `v*` tag builds the workspace binaries and attaches per-target archives + `SHA256SUMS` to that tag's GitHub release (no crates.io). The runner is **arm64**, so both non-native targets are cross-compiles - the doc covers the mingw-w64 / `cargo-zigbuild` setup and why the x86_64 GUI bins need a hand-unpacked amd64 ALSA sysroot. Archives carry binaries + licenses only, never game data. |
| [`shell-observer-traps.md`](docs/tooling/shell-observer-traps.md) | Three shell defects where the observer sits inside the thing it observes: pipe exit status read off the wrong stage, `pkill`/`pgrep -f` matching the caller's own command line, `grep`'s no-match exit 1 read as failure. Gate `check-shell-observer-traps.py`; helpers `scripts/lib/proc.sh`. |
| [`host-drift.md`](docs/tooling/host-drift.md) | The port ships **three** hosts on one engine (native play-window, browser play page, browser minigames page), so a feature wired into one is invisible in a diff. A ladder of gate tiers, each answering one shape and silent about the rest: builder reachability, paired constants, paired simulation injection sites, trait-override symmetry, no page-side keyboard table, diagnostics default-off on **both** hosts, and one render kernel per draw list across every surface. Also what a waiver may say. |
| [`shipped-bundle-freshness.md`](docs/tooling/shipped-bundle-freshness.md) | `site/wasm/` is uncommitted build output (CI rebuilds it at deploy), but a *local* bundle still goes stale, and its source closure is most of the workspace - so an engine edit changes the play page invisibly. Content-addressed stamp + `check-wasm-freshness.py`; the page records why mtime and `git log` both answer "in sync" for a stale bundle. |
| [`site-shell.md`](docs/tooling/site-shell.md) | The static site's app shell across breakpoints: rail / drawer / top bar, and why the rail's destinations must be re-rendered inside the drawer that replaces it. Three silent-shadowing traps, a gate each: a `@media` block adds **no** specificity (`check-css-cascade-order.py`); a case fold binds to one operand of a `+` chain (`check-js-case-fold-chains.py`); module-only syntax (`import.meta`) in a classic `<script src>` is a parse error that kills the whole file (`check-js-classic-module-syntax.py`). Also the page layer's delivery rules: one disc reaches a page's `onLoad` exactly once, `js/*.js` busting is content-addressed by `_gen.py` (never hand-written), and the WebGL2-only 3D pages raise a named banner instead of drawing untextured. |
| [`doc-density.md`](docs/tooling/doc-density.md) | The two doc gates, both hard pre-commit checks on the staged set (bypass with `LEGAIA_SKIP_PRECOMMIT=1`), both scoping `docs/` + crate READMEs + top-level `*.md`. `check-doc-density.py` flags >800-char lines and >150-word table cells. `check-md-links.py` resolves relative links + `#anchors` - a dead fragment silently jumps to the top of the page, so nothing but a checker catches it; when a link and a heading disagree, fix the link. |
| [`translation.md`](docs/tooling/translation.md) | `legaia-patcher translate export/init/strip/merge/stats/diff-disc/lift-official/fit-report/import` - community language packs. Disc text → editable YAML (SCUS name tables + the `0x1F`-segment dialog corpus: scene-bundle MANs + raw event-script carriers) → same-size in-place reimport (`translation` module; markup codec is byte-exact, per-character encodability errors; non-Latin scripts need a font patch, out of scope). Exported packs carry game text - gitignored (`/translations/`, `legaia_*.yaml`), never commit. |
| [`pal-localizations.md`](docs/tooling/pal-localizations.md) | Official PAL discs (`SCES_019.44`/`.45`/`.46` = FR/DE/IT). PROT.DAT is 1:1 with USA (1233 entries, same block boundaries). `translate lift-official` re-keys the official text onto USA coordinates; `diff-disc`/`fit-report` are the text-free alignment measurements. Key constraint: USA scene MANs are sector-aligned with **zero** compressed slack, so in-place growth fits only a small share of lines - the doc has the accent/CP437 layout and the fit numbers. |

### Crates - [`crates/`](crates/)

Each crate has a one-page `README.md` describing its scope, format coverage, and how it composes into the pipeline. Crate naming: package `legaia-foo`, lib `legaia_foo`. Internal deps go through workspace path entries (`legaia-asset = { path = "../asset" }`).

**Track 1 - preservation (asset → PNG / WAV / OBJ / JSON)**

| Crate | Binary | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| [`crates/bytes`](crates/bytes/README.md) | - | Checked little-endian byte readers. The leaf under the format stack, but **not** yet universal: only `legaia-asset` and `legaia-engine-core` depend on it - the older per-format crates hand-roll their reads. |
| [`crates/iso`](crates/iso/README.md) | `disc-extract` | PSX Mode2/2352 disc reader, ISO9660 walker, **sector write-back** (`write` module: EDC/ECC re-encode + `patch_file_logical`; `iso9660::find_file_in_image`). |
| [`crates/prot`](crates/prot/README.md) | `prot-extract` | PROT.DAT / DMY.DAT TOC, CDNAME map, standalone TIM-pack. |
| [`crates/lzs`](crates/lzs/README.md) | `lzs-decode` | Legaia LZS decoder (reversed from `FUN_8001a55c`) + `compress` re-packer (greedy LZSS the retail decoder accepts; for editing assets). |
| [`crates/asset`](crates/asset/README.md) | `asset` | The format hub: dispatcher, DATA_FIELD streaming, pack format, scene-bundle / effect-bundle / multi-bank-VAB detectors. `categorize` classifies every PROT entry by format class. `field_disasm` is the side-effect-free field-VM disassembler (`legaia-engine-vm` re-exports it for the executing VM). `inn_costs` locates the scripted gold charges - **retail has no inn cost table**. |
| [`crates/tmd`](crates/tmd/README.md) | `tmd` | Legaia TMD parser + primitive walker + OBJ-with-faces export. |
| [`crates/tim`](crates/tim/README.md) | `tim` | PSX TIM parser + PNG exporter + PNG-to-TIM encoder (texture replacement). |
| [`crates/xa`](crates/xa/README.md) | `xa` | XA-ADPCM decoder + WAV exporter. |
| [`crates/vab`](crates/vab/README.md) | `vab` | VAB sound bank extractor + SPU-ADPCM decoder. |
| [`crates/seq`](crates/seq/README.md) | `seq` | PsyQ SEQ parser + CLI inspector. |
| [`crates/mdt`](crates/mdt/README.md) | `mdt` | Move table (Tactical Arts) parser. |
| [`crates/art`](crates/art/README.md) | `art` | Tactical Arts data: ActionConstants, per-character art tables, Miracle/Super Art trigger matchers, art-record parser, the SCUS arts-name table decoder (`arts_table`), the arts-**voice** cue tables (`arts_voice` - the shout is CD-XA, per-character file + candidate-channel pool), and the byte-exact retail arts **tokenizer** (`tokenize` - a matched art keeps its leading arrows and arts overlap; derives every Super Art's physical input from its trigger pattern). |
| [`crates/mes`](crates/mes/README.md) | `mes` | MES dialog container parser (Compact + Records). |
| [`crates/anm`](crates/anm/README.md) | `anm` | ANM animation container parser. |
| [`crates/save`](crates/save/README.md) | `save-tool` | Per-character record schema (typed accessors + round-trip parse/write for the 0x414-byte record) plus a PSX memory-card walker. `Party::from_retail_sc_block` lifts a real SC block into a typed `Party`; `SaveExt` / `SaveFile` (LGSF) cover full engine save round-trips. |
| [`crates/font`](crates/font/README.md) | `font-extract` | Proportional dialog font: extracts width table + 4bpp atlas from `SCUS_942.54` + a mednafen save state, exposes a layout API for engine consumers. |
| [`crates/extract`](crates/extract/README.md) | `legaia-extract` | Top-level pipeline driver: disc → PROT → categorize → streaming sub-asset extract → PNG. |
| [`crates/mdec`](crates/mdec/README.md) | `mdec` | PSX MDEC from-scratch decoder. Legaia movies are the **Iki** bitstream, **not STRv2** - that's the thing to know before debugging a garbled frame. Frame → RGBA8 via the PSX AC VLC table, 8-point IDCT, YCbCr→RGB; `StrFrameAssembler` handles multi-sector STR video frames. |
| [`crates/mednafen`](crates/mednafen/README.md) | `mednafen-state` | Mednafen save-state parser + watchpoint-equivalent automation (pairwise main-RAM diff, write-transition bisection, scenario manifest [`scripts/scenarios.toml`](scripts/scenarios.toml)). `gpu`/`vram-dump` decode the VRAM blob and `spu` exposes `PsxSpu` - the retail sides of the engine's VRAM and audio parity oracles. |
| [`crates/pcsxr`](crates/pcsxr/README.md) | `pcsxr-state` | PCSX-Redux save-state (`.sstate`) main-RAM reader, exposing `main_ram()` + VA readers + `scene_name()`/`game_mode()`/`player_pos()`; the CLI mirrors `mednafen-state`'s `extract` so scripts treat both emulators' states interchangeably. The bridge that feeds the cataloged playthrough anchors (`s1..s5`) into the engine's disc-gated field/opening oracles. |
| [`crates/gamedata`](crates/gamedata/README.md) | `gamedata-tool` | Curated game-data tables (arts, magic, items, weapons, armor, accessories, enemies, shops, casino, fishing, music tracks) mined from public walkthroughs; music table contributed by Stann0x. These are **ground-truth labels** for the binary records under RE, not disc data. See [`docs/reference/gamedata.md`](docs/reference/gamedata.md). |
| [`crates/cheats`](crates/cheats/README.md) | `cheat-tool` | Parser + classifier for third-party GameShark / Pro-Action-Replay cheat databases. Classifies codes by the RAM region they target; the pinned offsets (character record, inventory, battle actor, story flags) ground-truth the binary records. See [`docs/reference/cheats.md`](docs/reference/cheats.md). |
| [`crates/patcher`](crates/patcher/README.md) | `legaia-patcher` | Disc-patching toolkit for a user-supplied `.bin`: same-size in-place PROT-entry + named-file edits (`disc::DiscPatcher`), MAN relocation, `rng::SplitMix64`, PPF 3.0 output. One machinery, three families: the randomizer (drops, encounters, chests, steals, arts, doors, shops, casino, starting items/level, equipment, battle tuning), translation packs, and manual edits (`monster-block`, texture swaps). Several features are hand-assembled MIPS code hooks detoured into SCUS/overlay dead space; the [crate README](crates/patcher/README.md) carries the two traps that bite there (the R3000 load-delay slot, and **"zero is not dead"**). Full reference: [`docs/tooling/randomizer.md`](docs/tooling/randomizer.md). No Sony bytes. |

**Track 2 - engine reimplementation (from-scratch Rust)**

| Crate | Binary | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| [`crates/engine-core`](crates/engine-core/README.md) | - | The simulation half of the engine, renderer-free: world state, scene host + scene resources, dialog panel / option picker / `inline_dialogue` runner, mode-menu-world dispatch, BGM director, camera controller, menu runtime, disk save/load (LGSF), shop / inn / level-up / tactical-arts session state, battle loot grants, and the minigame rules engines (`dance`, `baka_fighter`, `muscle_dome`). Module-by-module map in the [crate README](crates/engine-core/README.md). |
| [`crates/engine-ui`](crates/engine-ui/README.md) | - | Renderer-agnostic UI draw-list builders (`TextDraw`/`SpriteDraw`, `ui_overlay`, `ui_menu/`, `ui_title_save/`, `ui_fishing`) plus the shared wgpu-free render kernels (`screen_prim`, `gte`, `vram_capture`, the `battle_intro` transition emitter). The wgpu-free leaf shared by the native renderer and the browser play page - the crate `web-viewer` can depend on where `engine-render` can't (hard wgpu link). |
| [`crates/engine-render`](crates/engine-render/README.md) | - | winit 0.30 + wgpu 26; software PSX VRAM (1024×512 R16Uint, per-prim CBA/TSB + CLUT decode in fragment shader); text overlay via the `legaia-font` atlas. |
| [`crates/engine-audio`](crates/engine-audio/README.md) | `note-trace` | cpal-backed audio mixer + from-scratch SPU + SsAPI-shape SEQ sequencer; BGM cross-fade + volume ramp; `audio-webaudio` feature adds `WebAudioOut` (`ScriptProcessorNode`-based) for WASM targets. |
| [`crates/engine-vm`](crates/engine-vm/README.md) | `field-disasm` | Actor / field / effect / move / **motion** VMs + battle-action SM + `battle_formulas` (damage / MP / accuracy / RNG / escape) + **world-map entity SM** (`FUN_801DA51C`, 5-state encounter/interact port). Re-exports the field-VM disassembler from `legaia-asset` (`field_disasm`). |
| [`crates/engine-shell`](crates/engine-shell/README.md) | `legaia-engine` | Top-level driver + `BootSession` + `AudioBgmDirector`; boots a CDNAME scene straight from `PROT.DAT`. Subcommands: `info`/`list-scenes`, `play` (tick N frames), `play-window` (the real 960×720 wgpu window - shop/inn/level-up overlays, `--party`; `--no-live-loop` / `--no-player-battle` turn off the default-on live loop and player-driven battles), `save`/`load`, `play-str` (MDEC video player), `record`/`replay`, `config set --binding`. Parity oracles `vram-oracle` / `mode-trace` / `audio-trace` / `pcm-trace` / `sim-trace`, plus synthetic-session drivers; `--help` groups every one. |
| [`crates/asset-viewer`](crates/asset-viewer/README.md) | `asset-viewer` | Combined viewer: TIM, TMD, VAB, SEQ, stage geometry, PROT browser, scene-bundle presets, `save-icons` sheet, dialog box, field-VM scene runner with dialog rendering, battle-scene SM driver, and `world` (the `engine-core` composite ticking over a CDNAME scene). |
| [`crates/web-viewer`](crates/web-viewer/README.md) | - | WASM target: disc browser, TIM thumbnails, a software TMD rasteriser and a per-entry MES/SEQ/VAB inspector, all in the browser. `field_scene` assembles a scene's **full map** via the shared `engine-core::field_env` kernel; `rom_patcher` runs the randomizer client-side (**nothing is uploaded** - the user's disc never leaves the tab, and the summary is spoiler-safe); `equipment_view` assembles a battle model from a chosen equipment loadout; `scene_export` bakes `.glb` downloads. |

### Ghidra-side scripts - [`ghidra/scripts/`](ghidra/scripts/)

Jython analysis scripts that run inside the `ghidra` compose service. The script catalogue lives in [`docs/tooling/ghidra.md`](docs/tooling/ghidra.md#script-catalogue). Per-function decompiled-C dumps land in `ghidra/scripts/funcs/<addr>.txt` (gitignored - they're Sony-derived).

### Host-side scripts - [`scripts/`](scripts/README.md)

Helper scripts that run on the host (not in the Ghidra container), mapped in [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md): `ci/` (the pre-commit + CI gates and build/install helpers), `ghidra-analysis/` (overlay extraction + MIPS/GTE disassembly), `asset-investigation/` (TIM/TMD/slot-4/scene RE one-offs), `recomp/` (static-recomp differential oracle), `vrc-diorama/` (VRChat battle diorama), `lib/` (sourced bash helpers), `git-hooks/` (the shipped hook), `engine/` + `replays/` (determinism-replay fixtures), plus `pcsx-redux/` + `mednafen/` capture automation. `scripts/scenarios.toml` (the capture-scenario manifest) and `manage-states.py` stay at the top level as operational entry points.

## Common commands

```bash
cargo build --release                                    # all binaries → target/release/
cargo fmt --all -- --check                               # CI gate
cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings    # CI gate (warnings = failure)
cargo test --workspace --release                         # CI runs --release
cargo test -p legaia-asset                               # single-crate
cargo test --workspace test_name                         # single test by name
```

Top-level pipeline (recommended for end-to-end runs):

```bash
./target/release/legaia-extract "/path/to/Legend of Legaia (USA).bin" --out extracted
```

`--skip-png` / `--skip-verify` skip the slow steps. See [`docs/tooling/extraction.md`](docs/tooling/extraction.md) for per-stage invocations.

### Disc-gated tests

Many integration tests touch a real disc and only run when `LEGAIA_DISC_BIN` points at a valid `.bin`:

```bash
LEGAIA_DISC_BIN="/path/to/Legend of Legaia (USA).bin" cargo test --workspace
```

Without the env var, every disc-gated test **skips and passes** - that's intentional, so CI works without redistributing Sony data. Don't change that gating. Find them with `grep -rl LEGAIA_DISC_BIN crates/*/tests`; each is named for what it covers. Two recurring shapes:

- **`crates/patcher/tests/*_real.rs`** - disc-round-trip oracles: patch a feature (drops / encounters / chests / steals / arts / doors / shops / starting items / starting level / equipment / item prices / unused content / weapon specialty / monster stats / move power / element affinity / spell costs) onto a scratch copy, re-decode off the patched image, assert the multiset/invariants are preserved + every touched sector stays EDC/ECC-valid + a fixed seed is byte-deterministic.
- **`crates/engine-core/tests/*_randomizer_runtime_e2e.rs`** - runtime oracles: patch the feature in memory, re-decode, then drive the *engine* grant kernel (`apply_battle_loot` / `apply_steal` / `buy_from_shop` / the field VM) to assert the runtime honors the patched value. Sidesteps the savestate RAM-cache trap; each keeps a baseline pass to stay non-vacuous.

Plus non-randomizer chains: `extract/validation_suite` (full pipeline), `engine-core/scene_chain_e2e` (every CDNAME scene's assets resolve), `engine-audio/real_bgm_chain` (SEQ+VAB through the mixer), `engine-shell/audio_trace` + `mednafen/real_spu_smoke` (SPU parity), `save/real_card_roundtrip` + `engine-core/end_to_end_gameplay_loop` (real memory-card saves; key on `~/.mednafen/sav/`, not `LEGAIA_DISC_BIN`).

## Conventions

- **Don't redistribute or commit any Sony-owned bytes** (executables, asset data, decompressed output). `extracted/` and `ghidra/projects/` are gitignored. CI runs without disc data.
- **Disc-dependent tests behind the same `LEGAIA_DISC_BIN` skip-pattern.** Tests must pass when the env var is unset.
- **Prefer adding a CLI subcommand to the existing per-crate binary** over a new binary unless the new tool spans crates. The pattern is `clap` derive + an enum of subcommands at the top of each `bin/<name>.rs`.
- **CI is strict.** `cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --all -- --check` both before pushing. A pre-commit hook is shipped - run `scripts/ci/install-hooks.sh` once per clone and the same gates run on every `git commit`. Set `LEGAIA_SKIP_PRECOMMIT=1` to bypass in emergencies.

## Cross-cutting facts that catch people out

These bite repeatedly across subsystems. Skim before chasing a "why is X broken / missing" thread.

- **"No static caller in `SCUS_942.54`" ≠ "dead in retail".** Most game logic lives in RAM overlays loaded at `0x801C0000+` (the field/event VM, the dialog renderer, the actor / battle / menu VMs). Treat zero static callers as "needs overlay sweep". Capture pipeline: [`docs/tooling/overlay-capture.md`](docs/tooling/overlay-capture.md).
- **A save state replays the RAM of the disc that booted it.** Loading a state onto a *different* (e.g. freshly patched) disc keeps the old resident SCUS, overlays, battle models and effect state - the disc bytes under test are masked until the game re-loads them, so a fix can look absent and a fixed defect can look present. Verify disc edits from a cold boot or a memory-card load, never a mid-battle state; bridge SCUS mismatches with `legaia-patcher scus-pokes`. Details: [`docs/tooling/pcsx-redux-automation.md`](docs/tooling/pcsx-redux-automation.md#memory-card-capture-tier).
- **MIPS LUI+ADDIU pairs are not auto-resolved by Ghidra's reference manager.** Direct xref queries return zero hits even when the address is heavily used. Use `ghidra/scripts/find_lui_writers.py` (edit `LO`/`HI` to your target range). Details: [`docs/tooling/ghidra.md`](docs/tooling/ghidra.md).
- **CDNAME `#define` numbers are raw in-RAM TOC indices, so every extraction filename label is shifted +2.** The named content for `#define name N` lives at extraction entry `N − 2` (`legaia_prot::cdname::block_for_extraction_index`), which is what dissolves historical "CDNAME labels mislead" cases such as `vab_01` carrying no VAB header. A CDNAME label is a hint, not a verdict: when attributing an entry, confirm with the loader-call constant or the magic bytes, and say which index space you mean. Details: [`docs/formats/cdname.md`](docs/formats/cdname.md#numbering-space).
- **An `(PROT entry N, offset K)` coordinate measured before the entry-size correction may name the wrong entry.** Entry size is the sector gap to the next entry (`toc[p+3] - toc[p+2]`, retail's own `FUN_8003E68C`). The superseded expression over-read into neighbours, so any constant whose `K` ran past entry `N`'s real end still points at the right *bytes* on the disc while naming the wrong *owner* - and it keeps working until something re-derives the entry. Three were found this way (kingdom bundles, battle atlases, title TIM), each off by one entry, one of them also wrong about how many members it had. When a constant of this shape fails, suspect the pairing before the reader. Details: [`prot.md`](docs/formats/prot.md).
- **LZS "decompresses without error" is not a validity signal.** The 4 KB ring buffer initialises to zeros, so most random inputs decode to plausible-looking output. Always magic-check the *decoded* bytes. Details: [`docs/formats/lzs.md`](docs/formats/lzs.md).
- **Legaia SEQ has a u32 BE version field** (not PsyQ's u16) and its meta events carry **NO MIDI variable-length `length` field** - `0xFF 0x51` + 3 tempo bytes (no `0x03`), `0xFF 0x2F` ends track (no `0x00`). Reading a phantom length byte drops the first-body tempo override, pinning playback ~3x fast against the 240 BPM placeholder header. Meta events preserve running status. `ppqn = 480`; engine `Sequencer` clocks in exact integer SPU samples. Details: [`docs/formats/seq.md`](docs/formats/seq.md).
- **SEQ data in `scene_vab_stream` entries lives at non-zero offsets.** Most retail BGM is wrapped: `[u32 chunk_header][VAB][chunk1_header][SEQ]`. Use `SceneAssets::seq_in_stream_entries` and `bgm_seq_offset` to slice past the wrapper. The `scene_chain_e2e` test exercises this end-to-end.
- **There is one pack format and two readers for it, plus the magic-prefixed effect bundle.** `asset::pack` reads the pack at offset 0; `prot::timpack` reads the same pack four bytes in, past a `(TIM_LIST << 24) | size` DATA_FIELD chunk header - which is what its `word_index*4 + 4` and its `marker == 0x01` test both encode. The former "field-pack" (`0x01059B84`) is that same chunk header on a scene's texture pack, not a third format ([`field-pack.md`](docs/formats/field-pack.md)). The effect bundle (`0x02018B0C`) is its own thing. See the pack pages linked under "Pack formats" above.
- **Legaia TMDs are a custom variant.** Magic `0x80000002`, custom 8-byte group header, per-mode descriptor table at `DAT_8007326c`. Details: [`docs/formats/tmd.md`](docs/formats/tmd.md).
- **Ghidra promotes intra-function labels to fake `FUN_xxxxxxxx` calls.** When you see `iVar = FUN_801xxxxx(); return iVar;` in a giant dispatcher's C decomp, cross-check `grep -n "0x<addr>" overlay_<dump>.txt` - if the address appears as a `j` target inside that same function's disassembly, it's a label, not a call. Each such "label-call" is really `addiu s8, s8, N; j epilogue` (the standard PC-delta exit idiom). Catalogued for FUN_801de840 in [`docs/subsystems/script-vm.md`](docs/subsystems/script-vm.md#intra-function-label-catalogue) - applies to the dispatcher pattern in any large MIPS function, not just the field VM.
- **Port and document from the disassembly, not the decompiled C.** The label-call idiom above is one form of a broader rule: the C is a rendering, and every artifact catalogued on the linked page has already put a false claim into this repo's docs - dropped register arguments, `||` as nested `if`s, reordered/dropped stores, Ghidra annotations read as evidence, dumps carrying only C at `0 instructions`, sweeps run over those dumps instead of over bytes, mis-based dumps off by a constant, absolute-only address scans blind to the `gp`-relative form, and `unaff_*`/`in_stack_*` read as proof of a fragment. How to spot each, and what counts as evidence: [`docs/tooling/ghidra.md`](docs/tooling/ghidra.md#decompiler-artifacts-that-have-produced-false-claims).

## Ghidra container quick reference

`docker-compose.yml` defines a single `ghidra` service, built from `docker/ghidra.Dockerfile` - a UID/GID-matched wrapper over `blacktop/ghidra:latest` so dumps come back owned by the host user:

- `./extracted:/data:ro` - disc-extracted files (read-only into Ghidra).
- `./ghidra/projects:/projects` - Ghidra project DB (gitignored; local only).
- `./ghidra/scripts:/scripts` - analysis scripts (read-write so dumps land back on host).

Workflow: `docker compose up -d ghidra` once, then `docker compose exec ghidra /ghidra/support/analyzeHeadless ...` per query. Don't restart the service per command. Full setup + per-query invocations: [`docs/tooling/ghidra.md`](docs/tooling/ghidra.md).

To add a new function dump, edit the `TARGETS` list in `ghidra/scripts/dump_funcs.py` and run the post-script - output lands in `ghidra/scripts/funcs/<addr>.txt`. Then update [`docs/reference/functions.md`](docs/reference/functions.md) if the entry point is notable.

For overlay-specific dumps use per-overlay scripts (e.g. `dump_shop_overlay.py`, `dump_levelup_overlay.py`, `dump_cutscene_overlay.py`, `dump_str_fmv_overlay.py`) following the `dump_pending_helpers.py` pattern: `in_program()` guard skips addresses not in the current program, and `out_path_for()` prefixes output as `overlay_<label>_<addr>.txt`. Run with `-process overlay_<label>.bin -noanalysis -postScript /scripts/dump_<label>.py`.

Jython 2.7 (Ghidra-bundled) chokes on Unicode in source unless an encoding declaration is added - keep `ghidra/scripts/*.py` ASCII-only.

## Writing rules for committed docs

- Present tense. State what the format / function / subsystem **is**, not when it was figured out.
- No session numbers, dates, "ported in session N" markers, before-vs-after counts.
- No rot-prone counts of project state (tests, crates, function-coverage percentages).
- Stable invariants of the disc itself (PROT entry counts, opcode counts) are fine.
- Provenance citations: `see ghidra/scripts/funcs/<addr>.txt` and `FUN_801XXXXXX in PROT entry NNNN_<name>`.
- Operational state (progress, dates, session logs, status tables) lives in git log + agent memory, not in committed docs. Don't cite agent-memory filenames from a committed doc either - they aren't public files.
- Keep prose out of table cells. A cell is a one-line "what this covers"; if it needs a paragraph, the paragraph goes in a section on the linked page. `scripts/ci/check-doc-density.py` enforces this (>800-char lines, >150-word cells) across `docs/`, crate READMEs, **and this file** - it is in scope precisely because it decayed furthest while exempt. Passing is a floor, not a target: prose that lands at 799 chars was written for the linter, not a reader.
