## What this is

New Grad Jobs is an automated board of entry-level jobs in every field (software, data,
engineering, finance, marketing, sales, healthcare, …) in the US, Canada and India.
A Python scraper pulls public ATS APIs (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday) plus JobSpy
(Indeed) about every 30 minutes in GitHub Actions. It filters for new-grad roles and
publishes static JSON/RSS. A Vite + React site at <https://jobs.riteshrana.engineer> is
built from that data and deployed to GitHub Pages. There is no server and no database.

## Repo map

## Setup

```bash
make setup                 # .venv + hash-locked runtime/dev deps + pre-commit hook (Python 3.11+)
make install               # re-install deps into an existing .venv
cd site && npm ci          # Node >= 20.19 (CI uses 22)
```

## Commands

```bash
make test                  # pytest; coverage floor 75% (pyproject.toml)
make lint                  # ruff + pre-commit --all-files
make format                # ruff --fix
make typecheck             # mypy (CI job is non-blocking for now)
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_config.py          # after any config.yml edit
NGJ_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp/ngj make run                     # real scrape (network, minutes)
.venv/bin/python scripts/check_integrity.py /tmp/ngj # validate that output

cd site
npm run fetch-data         # download live jobs/health/feed/descriptions into public/ (gitignored)
npm run dev                # dev server
npm test                   # vitest (src/lib coverage threshold 80% lines)
npm run lint               # eslint
npm run build              # dist/ incl. SEO pages; tolerates missing data
npm run build:fixtures     # build against site/test/fixtures
```

After `make run`, restore the two files that a local scrape rewrites:
`git checkout -- README.md data/market-history.json`.

## Architecture in brief

- **Pipeline** (`ngj.pipeline.run`): `plan_sources` binds one fetcher per enabled source
  (from `ngj.registry`) to `Settings`, and `fetch_all_sources` runs them concurrently.
  Then `deduplicate_jobs` → `filter_jobs` → `enrich_jobs` → `filter_safe_jobs` →
  `generate_jobs_json` → partial-collapse guard → `_publish` (history, jobs artifacts,
  feed, health, README sync). The run exits 1 on any write failure or a guard trip.
- **Errors are data:** adapters never raise for a single company. They return
  `SourceResult(jobs, errors=(SourceError(company, source, kind, status, message), ...))`.
  `health.json` summarizes them per source (status, failure ratio, failed companies).
- **Identity:** `job_id = "job_" + sha256(source + canonical URL)[:20]`. Tracking params
  are stripped, and there is a company/title/location fallback when a job has no URL.
  `id == job_id`. `first_seen` carries forward from the previous published run.
- **Near-miss tier:** `partition_jobs` splits postings into the curated set (jobs.json) and
  near misses that fail only soft rules (`jobs-extended.json`, capped by
  `filtering.max_near_misses`, each with `near_miss.reasons`). The site fetches that file only
  when a WIDEN SCOPE toggle is on and shows a row only when every reason is toggled on. Counts
  on the board, landing pages, feeds and README are always the curated set.
- **Collapse guard:** refuses to publish if the total drops more than 40% versus the
  previous run, or if a source that had more than 100 jobs returns 0. Override with
  `NGJ_ALLOW_DROP=1`.
- **Site data flow:** the scraper writes to `site/public/`. `vite build` copies it into
  `dist/` and generates SEO pages from it. The browser loads `jobs-index.json`, and fetches
  one `descriptions/<shard>.json` when a detail pane opens. Data URLs are relative
  (`base: './'`).

## Conventions

- **Tests first.** Add or adjust a pytest/vitest test that fails, then fix. Tests must be
  deterministic: network is blocked (mark `@pytest.mark.network` only with a real reason),
  `time.sleep` > 0.1 s is a no-op unless marked `real_sleep`, and inject `now`.
- **Immutability.** Pipeline stages return new lists/dicts and never mutate their input.
  `Settings`, `SourceResult` and `SourceError` are frozen dataclasses. Pass `Settings`
  explicitly and add no module globals.
- **Python style:** type hints on every signature, `logging` (never `print`, except CLI
  JSON output), specific exceptions, named constants. Ruff config is in `pyproject.toml`
  (line length 120).
- **HTTP** goes through `ngj.http` (`limited_get` / `limited_post` / `get_session`) so
  retries, pooling, domain limits and the 403 cooldown apply.
- **Site:** keep data logic in `site/src/lib/` as pure, unit-tested functions. Components
  use inline styles and the `useIsMobile` hook for responsiveness.
- **Guides:** add a Markdown file to `site/content/guides/` with `title`, `description`,
  `updated`, `section` (one of `SECTION_ORDER` in `site/scripts/seo/guides.mjs`) and `order`
  front matter; the build renders it and groups the index by section. Use only headings, paragraphs, lists,
  quotes, bold, italics, code and links (the renderer supports nothing else) and claim
  nothing you cannot back.

### Where to add things

- **A company:** add `{name, url}` under `apis.greenhouse|lever|ashby.companies`
  (`https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>/jobs`,
  `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/<slug>`,
  `https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/<slug>`) or `{name, workday_url}` under
  `apis.workday.companies` (`https://<tenant>.wd<N>.myworkdayjobs.com/<site>`). Then run
  `validate_config.py`. Record removals in `docs/removed-companies.md`.
- **A new ATS source:** add `scripts/ngj/sources/<name>.py` returning `SourceResult`. Then
  register it in `ngj/registry.py` (`SOURCE_ORDER` + enable rule), wire it in
  `pipeline.plan_sources`, add knobs to `Settings` and schema checks to
  `validate_config.py`, and add tests with mocked HTTP.
- **A category:** `CATEGORY_PATTERNS` in `scripts/ngj/taxonomy.py` is canonical.
  `tests/test_category_taxonomy_sync.py` fails until you also add the id to
  `site/src/lib/taxonomy.js` (`CATEGORY_TYPE` and friends) and add a
  `<!-- COUNT:<id> -->0<!-- /COUNT -->` row to the README table.
- **A filter signal:** edit `filtering.*` in `config.yml`. Matching is token-boundary,
  never substring.

## Hard rules

1. **Honesty.** Never show invented, estimated or placeholder numbers on the site or in the
   README. Every count and stat must come from the published data.
2. **Never commit generated data:** `site/public/{jobs.json, jobs-index.json, descriptions/,
   jobs-extended.json, corpus-index.json, feed.xml, feeds/, health.json}` are gitignored and exist only in the Pages deployment.
3. **README:** edit only outside `<!-- COUNT:* -->…<!-- /COUNT -->` and the
   `<!-- CATEGORY-LISTINGS:START … -->`…`<!-- CATEGORY-LISTINGS:END -->` and
   `<!-- COMPANY-LISTINGS:START … -->`…`<!-- COMPANY-LISTINGS:END -->` blocks, which the
   scraper owns (the latter, and the `boards_*` counts, come from `config.yml`). Do not touch the sponsor blocks: the Zapply CTA copy is verbatim-locked,
   and the root-level `apply-faster-banner.png` and `get-started-button.png` must stay
   where they are. Leave the Tailr block as is too.
4. **Dependencies:** ranges live in `pyproject.toml`, and exact hash-locked versions in
   `requirements*.txt`. After changing dependencies, run `make lock` (needs `uv`) and
   commit both files. Keep the ruff pin in step with `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. For the
   site, commit `package-lock.json`.
5. **Conventional commits** (`feat|fix|docs|test|chore|refactor|perf|ci: …`). PRs are
   squash-merged.
6. **Required CI must pass:** `lint` (ruff, actionlint, validate_config), `typecheck` (mypy),
   `test (3.11)`, `test (3.13)`, `site` (eslint, vitest, build, Playwright e2e + axe) and pre-commit. Do not rename these jobs:
   they are required status checks.
7. **Do not** edit `CHANGELOG.md` (the maintainer writes it), add secrets, loosen workflow
   `permissions`, or add a server, database or external scheduler.

## Deploy

`update-jobs.yml` runs on the `7,37 * * * *` cron, on dispatch, and on pushes to `main`
that touch `scripts/`, `config.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `site/` or the workflow. It
scrapes, runs `check_integrity.py`, runs `vite build` and uploads the Pages artifact. The
`deploy` job (deploy-pages) and the `persist` job (commits `README.md` +
`data/market-history.json`) then run on `main` only. `scraper-watchdog.yml` re-dispatches
the scrape when the live `health.json` is more than 3 h old. Rollback and troubleshooting
are in [docs/operations.md](docs/operations.md).

## Gotchas

- `pre-commit` in CI runs `--all-files`, so an untouched file with trailing whitespace can
  fail your PR.
- Imports inside `scripts/` are top-level (`from ngj...`, `from contracts import ...`),
  because `scripts/` is on `sys.path` (tests insert it in `conftest.py`).
- A local `make run` hits real APIs, reads the previous run from the live site, and
  rewrites `README.md` and `data/market-history.json`.
- The site's `public/` data is absent in a fresh clone. Run `npm run fetch-data` or
  `build:fixtures` before expecting a populated UI.
- Workday tenants fail in cohorts. Per-company errors are captured and reported in
  `health.json`, so a partial Workday result is not a pipeline bug.
- `docs/superpowers/` is gitignored local planning and is not project docs.
