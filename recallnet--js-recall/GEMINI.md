# API Engineering Standards (apps/api)

## Database & Schema Management

### Database Schema Organization
- All database schemas must be placed in `packages/db/src/schemas/` with appropriate subdirectories (`core/`, `auth/`, etc.)
- Schema files must export table definitions and be properly imported in `core/defs.ts`
- Always generate migrations using `pnpm db:gen-migrations` after schema changes which will automatically create the sql migration files
- Repository classes must be placed in `apps/api/src/database/repositories/` and follow the naming pattern `*-repository.ts`
- Use the established repository pattern with dependency injection into manager services
- Include proper indexes for foreign keys and frequently queried columns

### Database Computation Patterns
- **SQL-First Philosophy**: Always prefer database aggregations over in-memory processing
  - Use SQL `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()` instead of fetching all rows and calculating in JavaScript
  - Use `DISTINCT ON` with proper indexes for latest-record queries
  - Use database-level `GROUP BY` for grouping operations
  - Use CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex multi-step queries
  - Use `ORDER BY` in SQL instead of JavaScript `.sort()`
  - For complex sorts (like `DISTINCT ON` + different `ORDER BY`), use subqueries with `.as()` in Drizzle
  - Example: Getting latest summaries should use `DISTINCT ON (agent_id)` not fetch all and filter in memory
- **Response Size Management**:
  - Never return unbounded result sets for in-memory processing
  - Always aggregate at database level when only totals are needed
  - Example: Use `SUM(total_volume)` in SQL vs fetching 1000+ records to sum in JavaScript
  - Set reasonable LIMIT clauses for safety even on internal queries
  - Monitor query response sizes in production
- **Composite Indexes**: Always add indexes for:
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Columns used in `WHERE` clauses
  - Columns used in `ORDER BY` with `DISTINCT ON`
  - Multi-column patterns that match query patterns (e.g., `(agent_id, competition_id, timestamp DESC)`)
- **Query Optimization Principles**:
  - Prevent the linear query scaling problem: Instead of fetching a list then making separate queries per item, use joins or batch fetching
  - Use database cursors for large result sets
  - Leverage database window functions for ranking and analytics
  - Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to verify query performance
  - Batch operations should process in chunks (e.g., 100 records at a time)

### Migration Best Practices
- **Migration Generation**: Always use `pnpm --filter api db:gen-migrations` after schema changes
- **Migration Naming**: Let Drizzle auto-generate names (e.g., `0041_mighty_wolverine.sql`)
- **Migration Review**: Always review generated SQL before committing
- **Backward Compatibility**: Migrations must be backward compatible for zero-downtime deployments
- **Data Migrations**: Use separate scripts in `apps/api/scripts/` for data migrations, never mix schema and data migrations
- **Rollback Strategy**: Document rollback SQL for destructive changes in PR description
- **Testing Migrations**: Test migrations on a copy of production data when possible
- **Index Creation**: Create indexes `CONCURRENTLY` in production to avoid table locks

### Database Type Safety
- **Function Return Types**: All functions must have explicit return types
  - Never rely on TypeScript inference for return types
  - Be especially explicit for async functions (e.g., `Promise<User[]>`)
- **Named Types**: Prefer named types/interfaces over inline definitions
  - Extract complex return types into named interfaces
  - Reuse types when the same shape appears multiple times
- **JSON Fields**: Never use `any` for jsonb columns
  - Create type guard functions for runtime validation
  - Use Zod schemas for complex JSON structures
  - Example: `isValidPerpsConfig(data): data is PerpsConfig`
- **Numeric Types**: Always parse database numerics to numbers
  - Use `Number()` or `parseFloat()` for numeric columns
  - Never pass numeric strings to frontend
  - Be explicit about precision requirements
- **Enum Safety**: Use TypeScript enums or literal unions for database enums
- **Null Handling**: Explicitly handle nullable columns with proper types
  - Use `| null` not `| undefined` for nullable database fields
  - Consider using Result types for operations that may fail

## Atomic Operations & Race Condition Prevention

### Service Layer Atomicity
- **TOCTOU Prevention**: Avoid Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use patterns where state can change between check and action
  - ❌ Bad: Check participant limit separately from adding agent (race condition):
    ```typescript
    // Multiple agents could pass this check simultaneously!
    const competition = await getCompetition(competitionId);
    if (competition.registeredParticipants < competition.maxParticipants) {
      await addAgentToCompetition(competitionId, agentId);  // ⚠️ Limit could be exceeded!
      await incrementParticipantCount(competitionId);
    }
    ```
  - ✅ Good: Use transactions with row locks (from `competition-repository.ts`):
    ```typescript
    await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
      // Lock the competition row to prevent concurrent modifications
      const [competition] = await tx
        .select({ maxParticipants, registeredParticipants })
        .from(competitions)
        .where(eq(competitions.id, competitionId))
        .for("update");  // Row lock prevents other transactions from reading/modifying
      
      // Atomic insert with conflict handling
      const insertResult = await tx
        .insert(competitionAgents)
        .values({ competitionId, agentId })
        .onConflictDoNothing()
        .returning();
      
      // Only check limit if actually inserted (not duplicate)
      if (insertResult.length > 0) {
        if (competition.registeredParticipants + 1 > competition.maxParticipants) {
          throw new Error("Competition full");  // Transaction rollback keeps count accurate
        }
        // Update count atomically within same transaction
        await tx.update(competitions).set({
          registeredParticipants: sql`${competitions.registeredParticipants} + 1`
        });
      }
    });
    ```
- **State Validation**: For operations that depend on current state:
  - Validate state as close to the action as possible
  - Use database row locks (`SELECT FOR UPDATE`) for critical sections
  - Use optimistic locking with version numbers where appropriate

### Repository Layer Atomicity
- **Transaction Boundaries**: Use database transactions for multi-step operations
  - Wrap related database operations in `db.transaction()`
  - Ensure all-or-nothing semantics for data consistency
  - Example: Balance updates + trade creation must be atomic
- **Bulk Operations**: Process in transactions with appropriate batch sizes
  - Use `FOR UPDATE` locks when reading data that will be modified
  - Consider using `SELECT ... FOR NO KEY UPDATE` for better concurrency
- **Idempotency**: Design operations to be safely retryable
  - Use unique constraints and `ON CONFLICT` clauses
  - Store idempotency keys for critical operations

## Authentication & Security

### Authentication Patterns
- Agent authentication uses API keys via `Authorization: Bearer` header
- User authentication uses session-based auth with SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum)
- Never mix authentication patterns - each endpoint should use one consistent method
- All wallet verification must use nonce-based verification

### Security Operations
- Threat modeling required for new authentication flows
- Audit trails required for critical business operations
- Rate limiting required for all public endpoints
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service dependencies

## Testing Standards

### E2E Test Organization
- All E2E tests must be in `apps/api/e2e/tests/` directory
- Test helpers must be in `apps/api/e2e/utils/` directory
- Always reference and re-use existing test setup helpers (where applicable) - for example, in `apps/api/e2e/utils/test-helpers.ts`
- When implementing a new test, always first look at existing test patterns in other test files - for example, `apps/api/e2e/tests/user.test.ts` for examples that use the user authentication flow, and `apps/api/e2e/tests/agent.test.ts` that use the agent authentication flow

### Test Environment Requirements
- Whenever in doubt about how tests in the e2e testing suite are set up, always reference `apps/api/e2e/setup.ts`, `apps/api/e2e/utils/test-setup.ts`, `apps/api/e2e/run-tests.ts`, and `apps/api/vitest.config.ts` to ensure you have a complete understanding of the environment

### Testing Coverage Requirements
- All new manager service methods must have corresponding tests
- Wallet verification functionality must be tested with both success and failure scenarios
- Database operations should be tested with edge cases (duplicates, constraints)
- Authentication flows must be thoroughly tested
- Performance-critical changes require load testing validation

### Test Coverage Standards
- **Current Thresholds**: See `coverage.config.json` for current values
  - Global thresholds and package-specific overrides are defined there
  - Coverage is calculated across all packages in aggregate
  - The config file is the single source of truth for coverage requirements
- **Coverage Migration Strategy**:
  - New packages must start with 100% coverage requirements
  - Existing apps (api, comps) will gradually increase thresholds
  - Any new critical path code must have tests regardless of package thresholds
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% coverage required for:
  - Authentication flows
  - Payment/trading operations
  - Wallet verification
  - Competition scoring logic
  - Financial calculations (PnL, portfolio values)
- **Coverage Reporting**: All PRs must include coverage report via GitHub Actions
- **Test Data Management**: 
  - Never use production data in tests
  - Use factories or builders for test data generation
  - Maintain test data consistency across test suites
- **Test Quality Metrics**:
  - Tests should be deterministic (no flaky tests)
  - Tests should run in isolation
  - Tests should complete within reasonable time (< 30s for unit, < 2min for E2E)

### Running Tests
- To run tests using the e2e testing suite, you can use a format such as `cd apps/api && pnpm test:e2e name-of-test.test.ts`

## API Design Patterns

### Response Format Consistency
- All API responses must include `success: boolean` field
- Error responses must include `error: string` and `status: number` fields
- Use consistent HTTP status codes (400 for validation, 401 for auth, 409 for conflicts)
- Success responses should include relevant data fields and descriptive `message` when appropriate
- **Error Response Format**:
  ```typescript
  {
    success: false,
    error: string,
    status: number,
    details?: object, // Only in development
    requestId?: string
  }
  ```
- **Success Response Format**:
  ```typescript
  {
    success: true,
    data: T,
    message?: string,
    pagination?: {
      total: number,
      limit: number,
      offset: number,
      hasMore: boolean
    }
  }
  ```

### Route Organization
- Group routes by feature in `apps/api/src/routes/` (e.g., `agent.routes.ts`, `auth.routes.ts`)
- Use middleware for authentication consistently across related endpoints
- Keep route handlers thin - business logic belongs in manager services
- Use TypeScript types for request/response validation

### API Evolution & Compatibility
- Breaking changes DO NOT require version increments and deprecation notices
- Schema evolution must support gradual migration patterns
- Client SDK updates coordinated with API changes

## Service Layer Architecture

### Controller Patterns
- Controller functions should be focused primarily on serialization/deserialization of requests and responses
- Controllers should avoid any complex business logic, instead calling into specialized manager classes in the service layer to handle business logic.
- Controller functions should never call into the Repository layer directly.

### Manager Service Patterns
- Business logic must be in manager services (`apps/api/src/services/*-manager.service.ts`)
- Manager services should inject repository dependencies in constructor
- Use dependency injection pattern established in `AppContext`
- Keep manager methods focused on single responsibilities
- Always handle errors gracefully and return consistent result objects

### Service Method Design Patterns
- **Method Complexity:** If a service method has 3+ distinct steps (especially if labeled as "Step 1", "Step 2", etc.), consider extracting each step into a private helper method
- **Retry Logic Separation:** Extract retry logic with exponential backoff into dedicated helper methods rather than inline in business logic
- **Batch Operation Helpers:** Create reusable helpers for batch operations (batch fetching, batch processing) that can be shared across methods
- **Clear Method Contracts:** Helper methods should clearly indicate what they assume about their inputs:
  - Use descriptive names like `processWithValidatedData` vs just `processData`
  - Document preconditions in method comments
  - Consider using TypeScript branded types or type predicates for validated data
- **Fail-Fast in Service Methods:** 
  - Validate inputs and check preconditions at the start of public methods
  - Return early on invalid conditions rather than nesting the entire method body
  - Let helper methods assume valid inputs (since the public method already validated)
- **Unknown State Handling**:
  - Throw explicit errors for unexpected states (e.g., unknown enum values)
  - ❌ Bad: `default: logger.warn('Unknown type'); return;`
  - ✅ Good: `default: throw new Error(\`Unknown type: ${type}\`);`
  - Never silently log and continue when encountering invalid states
  - Makes bugs immediately visible in development/staging
  - Use exhaustive type checking with TypeScript's `never` type for enums

### Code Reuse & Method Implementation
- **Before implementing any new method**: Always search the codebase for similar existing functionality using semantic search or grep
- **If a similar method exists but is not adequate**: You must explicitly explain why the existing method cannot be used or extended, including:
  - What specific requirements the existing method doesn't meet
  - Why extending/modifying the existing method isn't feasible
  - Technical justification for creating a new method instead
- **Staff-Level Engineering Approach**: When working on any code in `apps/api`, approach all design decisions and trade-off analysis as a staff backend engineer at a FAANG company would. This means:
  - Evaluating all viable implementation options holistically
  - Considering long-term maintainability, scalability, and team velocity
  - Following industry best practices while making context-appropriate decisions
  - Ensuring the chosen solution is the best fit for the specific situation at hand
- **Document relationships**: If creating a new method that's similar to an existing one, document the relationship and differences in TSDoc comments

### Configuration Management
- Use `apps/api/src/config/index.ts` for centralized configuration
- Environment variables should be loaded once at startup, not per-request
- Validate required environment variables on application startup
- Use configuration objects rather than direct `process.env` access in business logic

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Requirements
- API endpoints must respond within 200ms for 95th percentile
- Critical business operations (wallet verification, trades) must emit metrics
- Caching strategy required for frequently accessed data (user sessions, price data)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Capacity planning and scaling thresholds must be documented
- **Query Optimization**:
  - Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` for all list endpoints
  - Default page size: 10-50 items (never unlimited)
  - Use database cursors for large result sets
  - Maximum query time: 5000ms before timeout (enforced at both database and application level)
  - Set statement_timeout in PostgreSQL for query-level enforcement
  - Use request timeout middleware for HTTP-level enforcement
- **Caching Considerations**:
  - **IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS**: Always ask the human before implementing caching:
    - "Should we add caching here? What TTL would be appropriate?"
    - "Is platform caching (e.g., Vercel) already handling this?"
    - "What are the staleness tolerance requirements?"
  - Consider platform-provided caching (e.g., Vercel's automatic caching)
  - Evaluate need for application-level caching on case-by-case basis
  - When implementing caching, consider:
    - Data volatility and staleness tolerance
    - Cache invalidation complexity
    - Memory/storage costs vs performance gains
  - Document caching decisions and TTLs in code comments
  - AI should NEVER implement caching without explicit human approval
- **Response Time SLAs**:
  - P95 < 200ms for reads
  - P95 < 500ms for writes
  - P95 < 1000ms for complex aggregations
  - P99 < 2000ms for all endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Default: 100 requests per minute per API key
  - Burst: Allow 20% over limit for 10 seconds
  - Return `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header

### Monitoring & Observability
- All API endpoints must include structured logging with request IDs
- Health check endpoints must validate all dependencies (DB, external APIs)
- Business metric tracking and performance SLIs/SLOs required
- **Metrics Collection (Implemented via Prometheus)**:
  - **Currently Collected**:
    - HTTP request duration (histogram with buckets: 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000ms)
    - HTTP request counts by method, route, status code
    - Database query duration and counts by operation, repository, method
    - Error tracking via Sentry integration
  - **Metrics Server**: Separate server on port 3003 (configurable via METRICS_PORT)
  - **Endpoint**: `/metrics` exposed without auth for internal monitoring
  - **Note**: Alert thresholds and alerting rules should be configured in external monitoring systems (e.g., Datadog, PagerDuty) that consume these metrics - not implemented in application code
  - **TODO/Aspirational** (not yet implemented):
    - Cache hit rates
    - Business metrics (trades/hour, active agents, competition participation)
- **Error Tracking & APM (Sentry)**:
  - **Configuration**:
    - Production sampling: 10% (traces and profiles)
    - Development sampling: 100%
    - Automatic sensitive data scrubbing (auth headers, cookies)
    - Database query monitoring via wrapped Drizzle operations
  - **IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS**: When integrating with external APIs:
    - Use `Sentry.addBreadcrumb()` for tracking API interactions
    - Use `Sentry.captureMessage()` with sampling for successful responses (1% sample rate)
    - Use `Sentry.captureException()` for all errors with context
    - Example pattern:
      ```typescript
      // Sample 1% of successful responses for monitoring
      const SAMPLING_RATE = 0.01;
      if (Math.random() < SAMPLING_RATE) {
        Sentry.captureMessage("External API Success", {
          level: "info",
          extra: { responseTime, endpoint, sampleData }
        });
      }
      ```
    - Mask sensitive data (e.g., wallet addresses, API keys) before logging
    - Never log full request/response bodies without sampling
- **Logging Standards**:
  - Structured JSON logging with trace ID correlation
  - Request ID propagation through all layers
  - Log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
  - Separate application and error logs
  - Never log sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII)
  - **Sampling Rates** (for high-volume logging):
    - HTTP requests: 10% by default (configurable via HTTP_LOG_SAMPLE_RATE)
    - Repository operations: 10% by default (configurable via REPOSITORY_LOG_SAMPLE_RATE)
    - Use `Math.random() < sampleRate` pattern for custom sampling
    - Always log errors regardless of sampling
- **Health Checks**:
  - `/health` - Basic liveness check
  - `/health/ready` - Readiness check including:
    - Database connectivity
    - Redis connectivity
    - External service availability
    - Disk space and memory usage

## Code Quality & Documentation

### Documentation Requirements
- All public manager service methods must have TSDoc comments
- Include `@param` and `@returns` documentation
- Document error conditions and side effects
- Repository methods should document database operations and constraints
- **Never use temporal/comparative language in comments**:
  - Avoid: "new", "optimized", "replaces", "improved", "efficient", "atomic", "better"
  - Describe what the method DOES, not how it compares to other implementations
  - Focus on behavior and contract, not implementation quality
- At the end of implementing a new feature, always check to see if this invalidates content in `apps/api/README.md` that must be updated
- For any new environment variables, ensure that `apps/api/.env.example`, `apps/api/.env.test`, and `.github/workflows/api-ci.yml` has been updated to include it
