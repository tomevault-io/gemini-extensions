# Organization General Practices

## Core Coding Philosophy
– **Simplicity:** Always prefer simple, understandable solutions.
– **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplication. Check for existing similar code/functionality before writing new code.
– **Cleanliness:** Keep the codebase clean, well-organized, and maintainable.
– **Environment Awareness:** Write code that correctly handles different environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).
– **Focused Changes:** Only make changes that are requested or clearly understood and directly related to the task. Avoid implementing unrelated improvements or refactors without explicit instruction (see Agent Task Scope below).
– **Incremental Improvement:** When fixing bugs, avoid introducing new patterns/technologies unless necessary after exhausting existing options. If a new pattern replaces an old one, remove the old implementation.
– **File Size:** Avoid overly long files. Consider refactoring files exceeding 200–300 lines
- **Function Size:** Avoid overly long functions.  Break up large functions using helper functions that encapsulate related functionality into smaller and more focused pieces.
– **Script Usage:** Avoid writing one-off scripts if a more integrated solution is feasible.

## Function Design & Complexity Management
- **Extract Helper Methods:** When a function exceeds ~30-40 lines or has distinct logical sections (e.g., validation, processing, output), extract helper methods. If you have numbered steps in comments (Step 1, Step 2, etc.), consider if each step should be its own function.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function should do ONE thing well. A function should either answer one question OR perform one action, not both.
- **Fail-Fast Pattern:** Check error conditions early and return/throw immediately. Don't carry invalid state through the entire function. This makes the happy path clearer and reduces nesting.
- **Avoid Redundant Checking:** Don't check the same condition multiple times across different functions. Check once at the boundary, then pass validated data to inner functions.
- **Clear Method Contracts:** Helper methods should clearly indicate via their name and signature what they assume (e.g., `calculateValueWithValidPrices` assumes prices are already validated).

## Efficient Code Patterns
- **Don't Compute What You Don't Need:** Avoid building intermediate data structures (arrays, objects) just to check a property. For example, don't build an array just to check if it's empty - use a boolean check directly.
- **Choose Appropriate Loops:** Use `for` loops when iteration count is known upfront, `while` for conditional iteration. Modern `for` loops are often cleaner than `while` with manual increment.
- **Early Exit Strategies:** Prefer methods that can exit early (`.some()`, `.every()`, `.find()`) over methods that process everything (`.filter().length`, `.map()`) when you just need a boolean or single result.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Separate "what failed" (detailed logging) from "should we continue" (control flow) logic. Log details where the failure is detected, make decisions based on simple booleans.
- **Push Computation to Data Layer:** When working with databases or external services:
  - Prefer aggregating/sorting/filtering at the source over fetching-then-processing
  - Example: SQL `SUM()` instead of fetching all rows to sum in JavaScript
  - Example: API filtering parameters instead of fetching all then filtering
  - This reduces memory usage, network transfer, and processing time

## Data Handling
– **Mocking:** Mock data *only* for automated tests. Never use mocked or stubbed data in development or production environments.
– **Secrets:** Ensure secrets, API keys, or passwords are *never* committed to the repository. Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions.

## Tooling Interaction
– **Non-Interactive Execution:** When using command-line tools or scripts, ensure they run in non-interactive mode to prevent hangs (e.g., append `| cat` to commands like `git log` if needed, use appropriate flags).

## Documentation
– **Inline Documentation:** Maintain excellent, thorough inline documentation (e.g., comments for functions, methods, types, classes, and complex logic).
– **READMEs:** When editing README files, conform to the [standard-readme](mdc:https:/github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) specification.
– **CRITICAL - No Temporal or Comparative Comments:** 
  - **NEVER** use words like "new", "optimized", "efficient", "replaces", "improved", "better", "faster", "atomic" in comments or TSDoc
  - **NEVER** reference what the code replaces or how it compares to previous versions
  - **NEVER** mention implementation optimizations (e.g., "avoids N+1", "uses atomic operations", "parallelized")
  - **DO** describe WHAT the method does and its contract/behavior
  - **DO** focus on the current functionality without historical context
  - Example: ❌ BAD: "Optimized method that efficiently fetches users avoiding N+1 queries"
  - Example: ✅ GOOD: "Fetches users with their associated posts in a single query"

## Security
- Be mindful of security best practices, especially when handling user input, authentication, authorization, or interacting with external services.
- Avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, insecure direct object references).

## Dead Code Prevention
- **Dead Code Detection**:
  - Remove unused functions immediately upon discovery
  - Use `grep` or semantic search to verify function usage before creating new ones
  - Prefer extending existing functions over creating similar ones
  - Remove commented-out code blocks (use version control for history)
  - **AI AGENT REQUIREMENT**: When implementing a new method that replaces an old one, you MUST remove the old implementation in the same changeset
- **Function Reuse Audit**:
  - Before implementing: Search for similar functionality using semantic search
  - Document why existing solutions don't work if creating new functions
  - Mark deprecated functions with `@deprecated` TSDoc tag
  - Include migration path in deprecation notice
- **Immediate Cleanup (Part of Regular Development)**:
  - **When implementing a replacement**: Remove the old implementation in the same PR
  - **After refactoring**: Delete the original code immediately, don't leave both versions

## Pull Request Standards
- **PR Documentation**: Create `.agent/pr-description-[feature].md` for all features
- **Required Sections**:
  - Summary of changes (what and why)
  - API changes (with request/response examples)
  - Database changes (with migration details)
  - Frontend changes (with screenshots if UI)
  - Testing approach
  - Performance impact analysis
  - Breaking changes (if any)
  - Deployment notes (if special steps required)
- **Review Checklist**:
  - [ ] Linter passes (`pnpm lint`)
  - [ ] Tests pass (`pnpm test`) - Note: Coverage thresholds vary by package
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  - [ ] No `any` types introduced
  - [ ] Database queries optimized
  - [ ] Migration tested (if applicable)
  - [ ] Performance impact assessed
  - [ ] New critical code has tests (even if package has 0% threshold)
- **PR Size Guidelines**:
  - Ideal: < 400 lines changed
  - Maximum: < 1000 lines changed
  - Split larger changes into multiple PRs
  - Use feature flags for gradual rollout

# Agent Collaboration & Workflow (.agent/ Directory)

The `.agent/` directory is used for maintaining development context and task tracking:

## Agent Task Scope (Preventing Sidequests)
- Focus solely on the requested task or bug fix.
- If you identify a related but separate issue or potential refactoring, document it (e.g., in `.agent/backlog.md` or as a comment) but **do not** implement it without explicit instruction.

## Specifications (`.agent/spec.md`)
- Create `spec.md` for new features or major changes.
- Ensure specs align with relevant GitHub issues.
- Get developer approval on specs before proceeding with implementation.
- Include clear acceptance criteria and requirements.

## Development Plans (`.agent/developer_plan.md`)
- Create `developer_plan.md` for tracking implementation steps.
- Break down tasks into clear, measurable phases.
- Outline not just *what* needs to be done, but *how* it interacts with existing code (key functions/components/packages involved) and *how* it will be tested.
- Include links to relevant documentation and examples.
- Track completion status for each task using checkboxes (`- [ ]` or `- [x]`).
- Document dependencies, prerequisites, and potential blockers.
- Split complex plans into multiple smaller plans/PRs if needed.
- Use `.agent/backlog.md` to track work identified but deferred for later.

## Task Management & Error Handling
- Use checkboxes within `developer_plan.md` to track completed items.
- Document blockers and dependencies clearly.
- Keep notes on additional work discovered during development.
- Track progress against acceptance criteria defined in `spec.md`.
- If you encounter errors during development (e.g., build failures, test failures), analyze the root cause and attempt to fix it. Document the error and the fix applied.

## Pull Requests (`.agent/pull_request.md`)
- Use `.agent/pull_request.md` to draft the description for pull requests.

## Development Tracking & Quality Gates
- **Commits:** Execute a `git add . && git commit -m "<description of the change>"` after each logical change or task completion.
- **Quality Checks:** All code changes **must** pass the mandatory quality checks defined in repository-specific rules (e.g., `repo-specific-config.mdc`). These checks typically include linting, formatting, documentation coverage, and building, and are often enforced by CI pipelines (e.g., `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`). Ensure these pass before marking a task as complete.

## Leveraging Context
- Utilize the documentation sources configured in the user's Cursor settings (as mentioned in the root README) for context on core technologies and SDKs.
- Refer to the repository structure and package descriptions outlined in repository-specific rules.
