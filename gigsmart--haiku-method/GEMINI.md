# H·AI·K·U Project

H·AI·K·U = Human + AI Knowledge Unification — a universal lifecycle framework for structured AI-assisted work.

Three-component project: **plugin** (Claude Code plugin), **paper** (methodology spec), **website** (Next.js 15 static site).

- Paper is the source of truth for methodology concepts
- Plugin is the source of truth for implementation (orchestrator, MCP tools, hooks, runtime behavior)
- **`plugin/studios/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the structural reference for studio/stage/unit/hat/feedback boundaries within the plugin** — the rules and contracts that apply across studios, distinct from any single implementation file. Read it before structural changes; conflict resolution between this doc and the plugin code is described in the doc's intro.
- Website presents all of the above to users

## Sync Discipline (CRITICAL)

## Concept-to-Implementation Mapping

| Concept | Paper Section | Plugin Implementation | Key Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intent | Elaboration phase | `.haiku/intents/{slug}/intent.md` | prompts/core.ts |
| Unit | Elaboration phase | `.haiku/intents/{slug}/stages/{stage}/units/unit-NN-*.md` | prompts/core.ts |
| Bolt | Execution phase | `iteration` field in iteration.json | orchestrator.ts |
| Studio | Profiles section | `plugin/studios/{name}/STUDIO.md` | studio.sh |
| Stage | Profiles section | `plugin/studios/{name}/stages/{stage}/STAGE.md` | stage.sh, orchestrator.ts |
| Hat | Profiles section | `plugin/studios/{name}/stages/{stage}/hats/{hat}.md` | prompts/core.ts |
| Review Agent | Quality Enforcement | `plugin/studios/{name}/stages/{stage}/review-agents/{agent}.md` | orchestrator.ts, prompts/core.ts |
| Fix Hats | Fix Loop | `fix_hats:` frontmatter on STAGE.md (ordered hat list dispatched against open feedback — typically ends with `feedback-assessor`) | orchestrator.ts (`resolveStageFixHats`, `review_fix` action) |
| Feedback Assessor | Fix Loop | Terminal hat in `fix_hats` that independently decides closure — `plugin/studios/{name}/stages/{stage}/hats/feedback-assessor.md` | orchestrator.ts |
| Studio Review Agent | Intent-Completion Review | `plugin/studios/{name}/review-agents/{agent}.md` (NOT per-stage) — runs by default after final stage gate; opt out with `intent_completion_review: false` on intent frontmatter | orchestrator.ts (`runIntentCompletionReview`, `readStudioReviewAgentPaths`) |
| Studio Fix Hat | Intent-Completion Review | `plugin/studios/{name}/fix-hats/{hat}.md` (NOT per-stage) — dispatched against intent-scope feedback | orchestrator.ts (`intent_completion_fix` action, `readStudioFixHatPaths`) |
| Feedback Triage | Quality Enforcement | `triaged_at:` on feedback frontmatter — pre-tick gate (`feedback-triage-gate.ts`) classifies open FBs before any handler dispatch; cross-stage findings are relocated via `haiku_feedback_move` rather than carrying a stage hint | state-tools.ts, orchestrator/workflow/feedback-triage-gate.ts |
| Phase Override | Stages section | `plugin/studios/{name}/stages/{stage}/phases/{PHASE}.md` | orchestrator.ts |
| Review Gate | Quality Enforcement | `review:` field in STAGE.md — `auto` (harness advances), `ask` (local human approval), `external` (blocks for external review system), `await` (blocks for external event), or compound list like `[external, ask]` (user chooses path) | orchestrator.ts |
| Operation Template | Operation phase | `plugin/studios/{name}/operations/{op}.md` | prompts/complex.ts |
| Reflection Dimension | Reflection phase | `plugin/studios/{name}/reflections/{dim}.md` | prompts/core.ts |
| Completion Criteria | Throughout | `quality_gates:` in unit/intent frontmatter, harness-enforced | orchestrator.ts, quality-gate.sh |
| Backpressure | Principles section | Quality gates enforced by harness, not agent | quality-gate.sh, orchestrator.ts |
| Operating Modes | Operating Modes section | interactive=HITL, /haiku:pickup=OHOTL, /haiku:autopilot=AHOTL | prompts/core.ts, prompts/complex.ts |
| Hard Gates | Execution phase | exit code enforcement in quality-gate.sh | orchestrator.ts |
| Persistence | Context Preservation | Environment-detected via `isGitRepo()` (git or filesystem) | state-tools.ts, git-worktree.ts |
| Providers | Memory Providers section | `plugin/schemas/providers/*.json`, `plugin/providers/*.md` | config.sh |
| Harness | N/A (implementation detail) | `--harness <name>` MCP arg or `HAIKU_HARNESS` env var; capability registry in `harness.ts`, instruction adaptation in `harness-instructions.ts` | harness.ts, harness-instructions.ts, orchestrator.ts, server.ts |
| Operations | Operation phase | /haiku:operate prompt | prompts/complex.ts |
| Architecture (canonical) | N/A — implementation reference | `plugin/studios/ARCHITECTURE.md` — boundaries, lifecycle, hat patterns, FB-as-unit fix-loop semantics. Read before any structural change to studios, stages, hats, or workflow tools | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Workflow-managed file boundary | Quality Enforcement | PreToolUse hook denies generic Read/Write/Edit on `units/*.md`, `feedback/*.md`, `intent.md`, `stages/*/state.json`. Agents go through MCP tools only; redirect messages name the right tool | hooks/guard-workflow-fields.ts |
| Unit CRUDL (MCP) | N/A — implementation | `haiku_unit_write` (create/rewrite, FM validators, DAG cycle detection, pending-only lifecycle), `haiku_unit_read` (body+title only — no FM exposed), `haiku_unit_set` (FM field update, lifecycle-enforced), `haiku_unit_delete` (pending only), `haiku_unit_list` | state-tools.ts |
| Feedback CRUDL (MCP) | N/A — implementation | `haiku_feedback_write` (body update, lifecycle-enforced), `haiku_feedback_read` (body+title only), `haiku_feedback` (create), `haiku_feedback_update` (status transitions, terminal-state-protected), `haiku_feedback_reject` (mark invalid), `haiku_feedback_delete`, `haiku_feedback_list` | state-tools.ts |
| FB-as-unit fix loop | Fix Loop / architecture §5 | Fixer hats edit the FB body via `haiku_feedback_write`; flagged units are read-only via `haiku_unit_read`. Hat progression via `haiku_feedback_advance_hat` / `haiku_feedback_reject_hat` (mirrors of unit equivalents). The workflow auto-closes the FB when the last hat in `fix_hats:` calls advance. Closed FBs become input to the next iteration of the upstream stage's elaborate phase, which authors corrective work — completed units are never modified (forward-only lifecycle) | state-tools.ts (`haiku_feedback_advance_hat`, `haiku_feedback_reject_hat`), orchestrator.ts (`review_fix`, `intent_completion_fix` dispatches) |
| Verifier hat | architecture §3 (plan-do-verify) | Terminal hat in every per-unit hat sequence. Body-only mandate (FM is workflow-engine territory). Validates substance, citation, internal consistency, decision-register consistency. Calls `haiku_unit_advance_hat` on pass, `haiku_unit_reject_hat` on fail | plugin/studios/{studio}/stages/{stage}/hats/verifier.md |

## H·AI·K·U Terminology (CRITICAL)

| H·AI·K·U Term | Agile Equivalent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Intent | Feature / Epic | The overall thing being built |
| Unit | Ticket / Story | A discrete piece of work within an intent |
| Bolt | Sprint | The iteration cycle an agent runs within a unit |
| Studio | (no equivalent) | A named lifecycle template (profile implementation) containing stages |
| Stage | (no equivalent) | A lifecycle phase within a studio, containing hats and review gates |
| Hat | Role | A behavioral role scoped to a stage, defined in `hats/{hat}.md` files within the stage directory |
| Review Gate | Quality Gate | A checkpoint between stages controlling advancement. `auto` = harness-only (no human). `ask` = local review UI, human approves/rejects via MCP response. `external` = blocks until external system (GitHub/GitLab) approves; signal detected primarily by branch merge detection, with URL-based CLI probing as fallback. `await` = blocks until an external event occurs (not a review — e.g., customer response, pipeline). Compound: `[external, ask]` = user chooses between external submission or local approval. |

### Hierarchy

```
Studio > Stage > Unit > Bolt
```

- **Studio** is NOT the same as Stage. Studio = the lifecycle template. Stage = a phase within it.
- **Unit** is NOT the same as Bolt. Unit = the work itself. Bolt = the iteration cycle within a unit.
- **Hat** is always scoped to a Stage, defined in `stages/{stage}/hats/{hat}.md` files. Project-level augmentation: `.haiku/studios/{studio}/stages/{stage}/hats/{hat}.md`.
