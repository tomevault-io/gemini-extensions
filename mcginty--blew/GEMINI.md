# blew — Project Guide for Codex

## What this is

A cross-platform BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) library for Rust, providing both Central and Peripheral roles with platform backends for Apple (CoreBluetooth via objc2), Linux (BlueZ via bluer), and Android (JNI + Kotlin).

## Why this exists

`blew` was extracted from [iroh-ble-transport](https://github.com/mcginty/iroh-ble-transport) (local clone: `~/git/iroh-ble-transport`) — that project is the primary driver for the API shape, L2CAP focus, and cross-platform requirements. When in doubt about a design decision, check what `iroh-ble-transport` needs. Many of the quirks handled here (e.g., post-connect MTU stability, L2CAP ergonomics) came directly from issues encountered there.

## Project goals

- L2CAP is a first-class transport, not an edge feature.
- Designed to run with as many concurrent L2CAP channels as the device and OS will allow.
- Backend-owned transports with explicit close/shutdown. Shared event-loop / reactor threads (Apple `L2capReactor`, Linux BlueZ, Android Kotlin coroutines) instead of per-channel worker threads. When a short-term fix is tempting, bias toward the reactor-shaped architecture anyway.

## Commands

Uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) for task management. Run `mise tasks` for the full list.

```sh
mise run build                           # build all crates
mise run test                            # run all tests (nextest)
mise run lint                            # clippy
mise run fmt                             # format
mise run fmt:check                       # check formatting
mise run deny                            # license/vulnerability audit
cargo run --example scan -p blew         # scan for 10s
cargo run --example advertise -p blew    # advertise GATT service
```

## Style

- No comments unless the logic is non-obvious. Don't add doc comments to code you didn't change.
- Don't add features, refactor, or "improve" code beyond what was asked.
- Clippy pedantic is enabled (`pedantic = "warn"` in blew). Fix warnings, don't suppress them unless there's a good reason.
- Test with nextest: `cargo nextest run --workspace`.
- **Update `CHANGELOG.md` alongside user-visible changes.** New entries go under
  `## [Unreleased]` (creating that heading if missing) in the `Added` / `Changed` /
  `Removed` / `Fixed` buckets. Breaking changes must also include a before/after
  snippet in the upgrade guide at the bottom of the file. Pure-internal refactors
  that don't alter public API or observable behavior can skip the changelog.

## Public API pattern

```rust
// Both roles are independent; use only what you need.
let central: Central = Central::new().await?;   // explicit type required — see below
let peripheral: Peripheral = Peripheral::new().await?;

let mut events = central.events();   // returns an impl Stream of CentralEvent
use tokio_stream::StreamExt as _;
while let Some(ev) = events.next().await { /* ... */ }

// Peripheral events are split by kind:
let mut state = peripheral.state_events();                  // Clone, broadcast fan-out
let mut requests = peripheral.take_requests()                // single-consumer; None on 2nd call
    .expect("requests already taken");
```

**`let central: Central` is required.** Rust's default type-parameter inference does not kick in for method calls; without the explicit annotation the compiler fails with E0283. Same for `Peripheral`.

## Apple backend design (`platform/apple/`)

**Threading model:**
- Each manager (`CBCentralManager`, `CBPeripheralManager`) is initialized with a dedicated GCD serial queue via `initWithDelegate_queue(Some(&queue))`.
- All CB delegate callbacks fire exclusively on that queue.
- Tokio tasks call CB methods directly from the thread pool; CoreBluetooth is documented thread-safe on macOS 10.15+ / iOS 13+.
- Results flow back to Tokio via `tokio::sync::oneshot` channels (set in the delegate callback, awaited in the async method).

**Key patterns:**

```rust
// ObjcSend<T> — asserts Send+Sync for Retained<T> when using a GCD queue.
struct ObjcSend<T: objc2::Message>(Retained<T>);
unsafe impl<T: objc2::Message> Send for ObjcSend<T> {}
unsafe impl<T: objc2::Message> Sync for ObjcSend<T> {}

// retain_send — retain a CB object and wrap it for cross-thread use.
unsafe fn retain_send<T: objc2::Message>(obj: &T) -> ObjcSend<T> {
    ObjcSend(Retained::retain(obj as *const T as *mut T).expect("retain"))
}

// Avoid holding Retained<T> (non-Send) across .await points.
// Pattern: do all ObjC work in a synchronous block, capture only the rx end.
let rx = {
    let peripheral = ...get ObjcSend<CBPeripheral>...;
    let (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();
    // ... ObjC calls ...
    rx
}; // peripheral drops here — before .await
rx.await...
```

**objc2 0.6 traits:**
- `use objc2::AnyThread` — provides `alloc()` for both user-defined classes (via `define_class!`) and external CB classes when initialized with a custom queue. (`AllocAnyThread` is a deprecated alias for the same trait.)
- `use objc2::DefinedClass` — provides `ivars()` inside `define_class!` method bodies.
- Both imports are required; missing either gives "no method found" errors.

**RAII responders:** `peripheralManager:didReceiveReadRequest:` and `didReceiveWriteRequests:` build a `ReadResponder`/`WriteResponder` (backed by an `oneshot::Sender`), emit a `PeripheralRequest` on the `mpsc::UnboundedSender` handed out by `take_requests()`, then spawn a task (via `inner.runtime.spawn()`) that awaits the oneshot and calls `respondToRequest:withResult:`. The spawn uses the captured `Handle` because GCD callbacks run outside the Tokio runtime context — bare `tokio::spawn` would panic. All Rust-side synchronization uses `parking_lot::Mutex` (poison-free, faster than `std::sync::Mutex`).

**L2CAP reactor** (`platform/apple/l2cap.rs`): one dedicated OS thread owns an `NSRunLoop` and all `NSInputStream`/`NSOutputStream` objects. Channels register via `ReactorCmd::Register { id, channel_ref, input, output, inbound_tx }`, writes go via `ReactorCmd::Write`, close via `ReactorCmd::Close`. Bytes flow Reactor→App through `mpsc::UnboundedSender<Vec<u8>>`; App→Reactor through a `tokio::io::duplex` + outbound bridge task. No per-channel threads.

**L2CAP close invariant:** exactly one `ReactorCmd::Close` per channel. `DuplexTransport::trigger_close` uses `Option::take` on the close hook so `.close().await` and `Drop` both route to the same single-fire path. **Do not** add defensive `ReactorCmd::Close` sends from the bridge tasks — the hook is the only sender.

**L2CAP accept channel policy:**
- Apple: `mpsc::unbounded_channel()`. Blocking the GCD delegate queue on `blocking_send` would stall every subsequent CB callback (disconnects, restore, etc.).
- Android: `mpsc::unbounded_channel()`. `try_send` on a bounded channel would silently drop incoming L2CAP connections.
- Linux: `mpsc::channel(16)` + `send().await`. Backpressure flows into BlueZ's kernel-side socket accept queue, which is the right place to cap.

## Event fan-out convention

All Central event streams and Peripheral `state_events()` streams use
`tokio::sync::broadcast::channel(256)` wrapped in `util::BroadcastEventStream`.
The wrapper silently drops `Lagged(n)` errors so slow subscribers miss events
but stay connected. Don't introduce new custom fan-out utilities — use
`broadcast::Sender` directly (it's `Clone + Sync`; no external `Mutex` needed).

Buffer depth is 256 across every role/backend; keep it uniform unless there's
a specific reason to diverge. Backend-emitted `send()` calls should be
`let _ = tx.send(event);` because broadcast returns `Err(SendError)` when
there are zero subscribers (normal at startup and for apps that don't need events).

## iOS state restoration (Apple-only surface)

`Central::take_restored()` and `Peripheral::take_restored()` are **not** on the
sealed `CentralBackend` / `PeripheralBackend` traits. They live as inherent
methods on Apple-only `impl` blocks:

```rust
#[cfg(target_vendor = "apple")]
impl Peripheral { pub fn take_restored(&self) -> Option<Vec<Uuid>> { … } }
```

Mocks get their own `impl Peripheral<MockPeripheral>` block in `testing.rs`.
Non-Apple backends have no stub method. Any code that calls `take_restored()`
on a shared cross-platform path must `#[cfg(target_vendor = "apple")]`-gate the
call. `restore_identifier` on `PeripheralConfig` / `CentralConfig` remains
cross-platform (inert on non-Apple) so `with_config` can be called unconditionally.

Android has no `willRestoreState:` equivalent. If background scan survival
becomes a requirement, the natural surface is a separate `PendingIntent`-backed
API (see Android's BLE background guide), **not** an extension of `take_restored`.

## CoreBluetooth rules that cause crashes

**Static value + Write property = `NSInvalidArgumentException` → SIGABRT.**
If `GattCharacteristic.value` is non-empty, CoreBluetooth treats the characteristic as static and throws if the characteristic also has the `Write` property. Use `value: vec![]` for any characteristic that needs to be writable; the app handles reads via `PeripheralRequest::Read`.

```rust
GattCharacteristic {
    properties: CharacteristicProperties::READ | CharacteristicProperties::WRITE,
    permissions: AttributePermissions::READ | AttributePermissions::WRITE,
    value: vec![],   // MUST be empty for writable characteristics
    ..
}
```

## Linux backend design (`platform/linux/`)

Uses `bluer 0.17` (official BlueZ Rust bindings over D-Bus).

**Threading model:** bluer is async-native (tokio). All calls go through the tokio runtime; no GCD queues or spawn_blocking needed. `Session::new().await` + `session.default_adapter().await` in `new()`.

**Key patterns:**

- **Scan**: `adapter.discover_devices().await?` returns `impl Stream<Item = AdapterEvent>`. Must be `Box::pin`-ned before iterating since the concrete type may not be `Unpin`. `AdapterEvent` has only `DeviceAdded(Address)` and `DeviceRemoved(Address)` variants.
- **CharacteristicFlags**: `ch.flags().await?` returns a `CharacteristicFlags` **struct with bool fields** (`.read`, `.write`, `.notify`, etc.), not an enum or `HashSet`. Access fields directly.
- **Write Command vs Write Request**: Remote `Characteristic` has `write()` (D-Bus, Write Request/response) and `write_io()` (kernel socket fd, Write Command/no-response). Use `write_io()` for `WriteType::WithoutResponse` to avoid D-Bus latency; `write()` for `WriteType::WithResponse`.
- **Notifications**: `ch.notify_io().await?` returns `CharacteristicReader: AsyncRead`. Spawn a task reading chunks.
- **GATT server callbacks**: `CharacteristicRead { fun: Box<dyn Fn(CharacteristicReadRequest) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = ReqResult<Vec<u8>>> + Send>>> }`. The future IS the ATT response — the server waits for it to complete. Bridge to `ReadResponder`/`WriteResponder` via `oneshot::channel`.
- **`CharacteristicNotifier`**: Received via `CharacteristicNotifyMethod::Fun` callback when a client subscribes. Store as `Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<CharacteristicNotifier>>` (not std Mutex) so `notifier.notify(value).await` doesn't hold a MutexGuard across an await point. `notifier.notify(value: Vec<u8>)` takes ownership.
- **L2CAP server**: `bluer::l2cap::StreamListener::bind(SocketAddr::any_le())` gets dynamic PSM. `listener.as_ref().local_addr()?.psm` reads it back.
- **L2CAP client**: `device.address_type().await?` for `bluer::AddressType`, then `bluer::l2cap::Stream::connect(SocketAddr::new(addr, addr_type, psm))`. Add ~200ms delay after ACL connect before L2CAP CoC setup.
- **L2CAP bridging**: `bluer::l2cap::Stream` implements `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` directly — just two `tokio::io::copy` tasks into a `tokio::io::duplex`. Much simpler than Apple.

**bluer API gotchas:**
- `Service`, `Characteristic`, `Application` do **not** derive `Default` — construct them field-by-field. `ServiceControlHandle::default()` and `CharacteristicControlHandle::default()` exist and are used for the `control_handle` fields.
- `CharacteristicWrite.write` = Write Request (with response); `CharacteristicWrite.write_without_response` = Write Command (no response). The doc comment on `write` saying "Write Command" is incorrect — trust `set_characteristic_flags` which maps directly to `CharacteristicFlags.write` = BlueZ "write" property = Write Request.
- `WriteOp::Request` in `CharacteristicWriteRequest.op_type` indicates a Write Request needing a response.

## Android backend design (`platform/android/`)

Uses `jni 0.22` and `ndk-context 0.1`. The Android BLE API is Java/Kotlin-only, so the backend bridges Rust ↔ Kotlin via JNI.

**Architecture:**
- **Kotlin singletons** (`BleCentralManager`, `BlePeripheralManager`) live in `crates/blew/android/` (co-located with the Rust JNI hooks so they link-time version together). They wrap `BluetoothLeScanner`, `BluetoothGatt`, `BluetoothGattServer`, and `BluetoothLeAdvertiser`.
- **Rust → Kotlin**: `jvm().attach_current_thread()` then `call_static_method` on Kotlin object singletons.
- **Kotlin → Rust**: `@JvmStatic external fun` declarations in Kotlin, implemented as `#[unsafe(no_mangle)] extern "C"` in `jni_hooks.rs`.

**Classloader gotcha:** Rust background threads use the system classloader, which cannot find APK classes. `init_jvm()` caches `GlobalRef`s to both Kotlin classes on the main thread (which has the app classloader). All JNI calls use `central_class()` / `peripheral_class()` from `jni_globals.rs` instead of string class names.

**Threading model:** Android BLE callbacks arrive on Binder threads. JNI hooks push events into tokio `mpsc` channels and return immediately. Rust async code awaits these channels. JNI `AttachGuard` is NOT `Send` — always drop it in a block before any `.await` point:

```rust
// Correct pattern — env drops before await:
{
    let mut env = jvm().attach_current_thread()?;
    env.call_static_method(...)?;
} // env dropped here
rx.await?; // safe to await now
```

**Global state:** Module-level `OnceLock` statics store event channels and pending operation maps. Only one Bluetooth adapter exists on Android so singletons are correct.

- `AndroidCentral`: uses a `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel (central events are `Clone`; wrapped in `BroadcastEventStream` so slow-subscriber lag is swallowed) + `KeyedRequestMap<oneshot::Sender>` for async request/response coupling. A per-device Kotlin coroutine queue serializes GATT ops (replacing the old adapter-wide semaphore) so a slow peer can't block others.
- `AndroidPeripheral`: state events fan out through `tokio::sync::broadcast` (`PeripheralStateEvent` is `Clone`). GATT reads/writes are delivered as `PeripheralRequest` over an `mpsc::UnboundedSender`, handed out once via `take_requests()`. For each request, a tokio task awaits the responder's oneshot then calls Kotlin `respondToRead`/`respondToWrite` via JNI. All Rust-side synchronization uses `parking_lot::Mutex`.

**JNI data marshalling:** Complex data (GATT services, UUID lists) passed as flat arrays or JSON strings to avoid complex JNI type construction. Service characteristics use parallel arrays (uuids, properties, permissions, values).

**L2CAP:** Implemented via `L2capSocketManager.kt` — JNI hooks bridge `BluetoothServerSocket`/`BluetoothSocket` to Rust `L2capChannel` (AsyncRead + AsyncWrite). Global state in `l2cap_state.rs`.

**Auto MTU negotiation:** `BleCentralManager.kt` calls `requestMtu(512)` automatically after connecting.

**Connect reliability invariants (all three backends, Android load-bearing):**

- `CentralConfig::connect_timeout: Option<Duration>` bounds `connect()`. The
  `Default` is 15s. On elapse every backend returns `BlewError::ConnectTimedOut`
  and emits `CentralEvent::DeviceDisconnected { cause: Timeout }`. `None`
  restores pre-0.3 unbounded behavior. `BlewError::Timeout` is now reserved
  for adapter-readiness waits (`wait_ready` / `wait_powered`) and is **not**
  used by the connect path. Keep it that way — splitting the two lets callers
  match precisely.
- Overlapping `connect()` on the same device is rejected with
  `BlewError::ConnectInFlight(DeviceId)` on Apple and Android (built on
  `KeyedRequestMap::try_insert`). Linux relies on bluer's own state machine.
  Do not reintroduce "latest wins" eviction — it silently orphans the first
  caller's oneshot.
- Android `disconnect()` **awaits** `onConnectionStateChange(DISCONNECTED)`
  with a 2s fallback. On fallback it calls Kotlin `forceClose(addr)` which
  synchronously removes the handle from `gattConnections`, invokes the hidden
  `refresh()`, and calls `gatt.close()`. This prevents leaking client-IF
  slots (Android caps at ~7). Do not revert to fire-and-forget disconnect.
- Status-133 zombie handling lives in Kotlin: on
  `onConnectionStateChange(DISCONNECTED, status=133)` the backend calls
  `refresh()` **before** `close()` to flush the client-side service cache.
  `BleCentralManager.connect()`'s stale-cleanup path does the same and then
  `delay(300)` before the next `connectGatt()` — back-to-back `connectGatt`
  attempts to the same address can be silently dropped by some vendor stacks.

## `crates/tauri-plugin-blew` — Tauri plugin for Android BLE setup

A thin Tauri 2 integration wrapper. The Kotlin BLE classes now live in `crates/blew/android/`; this crate just points Tauri's Gradle build at that path and initializes the JNI bridge.

**Rust side** (`src/lib.rs`): On Android, stores the JVM reference in blew's `OnceLock` via `blew::platform::android::init_jvm()`, then registers the Android plugin. `build.rs` computes the path to `../blew/android` and passes it to `tauri_plugin::Builder::android_path()`.

**Kotlin side** (lives at `crates/blew/android/src/main/java/org/jakebot/blew/`):
- `BlewPlugin.kt` — `@TauriPlugin`, initializes BLE managers, requests runtime permissions (BLUETOOTH_SCAN/CONNECT/ADVERTISE on Android 12+; ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION on pre-12 only). `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` is declared with `neverForLocation` so scan results are delivered regardless of the OS-level Location Services toggle.
- `BleCentralManager.kt` — Singleton wrapping scanner + GATT client. `ScanCallback` → `nativeOnDeviceDiscovered`. `BluetoothGattCallback` → `nativeOnConnectionStateChanged`, `nativeOnServicesDiscovered`, `nativeOnCharacteristicRead/Write/Changed`, `nativeOnMtuChanged`.
- `BlePeripheralManager.kt` — Singleton wrapping GATT server + advertiser. `BluetoothGattServerCallback` → `nativeOnReadRequest`, `nativeOnWriteRequest`, `nativeOnSubscriptionChanged`, `nativeOnConnectionStateChanged`, `nativeOnAdapterStateChanged`.

**AndroidManifest.xml:** Declares BLE permissions with `maxSdkVersion` guards. These merge into the app manifest automatically via Gradle.

**Usage in a Tauri app:**
```rust
// Cargo.toml: [target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]
// tauri-plugin-blew = { git = "https://github.com/mcginty/blew.git" }

#[allow(unused_mut)]
let mut builder = tauri::Builder::default();
#[cfg(target_os = "android")]
{ builder = builder.plugin(tauri_plugin_blew::init()); }
```

## Examples

```sh
cargo run --example scan -p blew          # scan for 10 s, print discoveries
cargo run --example advertise -p blew     # advertise a GATT service, handle reads/writes
cargo run --example l2cap_server -p blew  # peripheral: publish L2CAP CoC, echo data
cargo run --example l2cap_client -p blew  # central: scan, connect, open L2CAP, send data
```

All use `#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]` since the blew tokio dependency only enables the `rt` (not `rt-multi-thread`) feature.
