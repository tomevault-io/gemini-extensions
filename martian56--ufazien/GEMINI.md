Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

Ufazien is a student platform: grade calculators, a blog, a community with real-time chat, a mini web-hosting service for student projects, and a multiplayer 3D campus with proximity voice. Django REST API plus a React SPA. It is deployed and has real users, so changes here reach people.

## Layout

```
backend/     Django project `ufazien`, one app per feature
frontend/    React 19 + Vite SPA
hosting/     nginx + php-fpm compose resource serving *.ufazien.com user sites
```

Backend apps: `api` `users` `blog` `gpa` `average` `game` `ai_tools` `hosting` `community` `schedule`.

Two naming traps:

- **`game`** is the campus simulator. **`schedule`** is the calendar. It is not called `calendar` because a top-level `calendar` package would shadow the standard library module Django itself imports.
- **`hosting`** is the mini-PaaS (user websites and databases). The `hosting/` directory at the repo root is unrelated: it is the nginx/php compose stack.

## Running it

```bash
# backend
cd backend && python -m venv .venv && source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
SECRET_KEY=dev python manage.py migrate
SECRET_KEY=dev python manage.py runserver

# frontend
cd frontend && bun install
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 bun run dev
```

`SECRET_KEY` is required. The database is SQLite unless `ENVIRONMENT=production`, so no server is needed locally.

Use `requirements-dev.txt`, not `requirements.txt`: the WebSocket tests import `channels.testing`, which pulls in `daphne`. Production serves ASGI with uvicorn and does not install it.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend && SECRET_KEY=test python manage.py test          # all
cd backend && SECRET_KEY=test python manage.py test community
```

Add tests for what you change. Most apps' `tests.py` began as an empty stub, and everything they now cover was a bug that reached production unnoticed.

The frontend runs Vitest: `bun run test`, with `bun run typecheck` for types. Coverage is thin and
starts at the API client, so a browser check still matters for anything visual. Say what you checked.

## Rules that matter here

**A user's email must never reach another user.** `email` is a `SerializerMethodField` that returns the address only to its owner, and `None` otherwise, including when there is no request in context, which is how WebSocket consumers serialize. See `community/serializers.py`; `community/tests.py` guards it. This leaked in production once.

**Scope user-owned data to its owner in `get_queryset`.** Another user's record should 404, not merely be absent from a list. `schedule/views.py` is the reference.

**Permissions are decided server-side.** The LiveKit token lists exactly which sources a participant may publish, derived from `LobbyMember` fields, so a modified client cannot grant itself the microphone or a screen share. Never move that decision into the browser.

**Never commit secrets.** `.env`, keys and certificates are gitignored. A private key was committed here once and is still in history.

**`SECRET_KEY` is read from the environment and has no fallback.** There used
to be a literal default, which made the published contents of this repository
the signing key for anybody who had not set the variable — and everything
Django signs comes from it, including the JWTs the API authenticates with.
Guarding it behind `DEBUG` was not enough, because a box brought up with
`DJANGO_DEBUG=true` still ran on the published key, so the default is gone and
Django refuses to start without one in any mode. `SECRET_KEY=dev` locally, as
the commands above already show. Setting it in production for the first time
signs everybody out once; that is the rotation working.

**Credentials are minted server-side, and a password is rotated on the server
that holds it.** A hosting database's `username` and `password` are read-only
on the serializer: the browser used to generate both with `Math.random()` and
post them, and what it sent became the real credential. `change_password` runs
`ALTER ROLE`/`ALTER USER` through `set_database_password` and writes the row
only once the server has accepted it — it used to assign the field and save, so
the dashboard showed a new password while the real user kept the old one.

**A site's files are reached through `path_within`, never `startswith`.**
`/srv/hosting/alice` starts with `/srv/hosting/a`, and people choose their own
subdomains, so the prefix check that used to guard `delete_file` and
`download_file` let a site called `a` read and delete files in every site whose
name began with an `a`. It resolves with `realpath` and compares with
`commonpath`, which also closes a symlink planted inside the site.

**Subdomains go through `hosting/domains.py`.** The name becomes a directory on
disk and the root nginx serves, so it is not free text: `check()` lower-cases
it, rejects anything that is not a hostname, and refuses the reserved list —
`admin`, `login`, `api` and the rest. A site on `login.ufazien.com`, served
under the platform's own wildcard certificate, is a convincing place to ask
somebody for a password.

**Every site shares one php-fpm pool, so `open_basedir` is what separates
them.** `hosting/nginx/hosting.conf` sets it per request from the subdomain
`server_name` already captured; the pool is shared, so it cannot go in the pool
config. `/tmp` has to stay in the list — sessions and uploads live there, and a
basedir without it breaks any site that accepts a form. Verified by serving two
sites and reading one from the other.

## Traps this codebase has

**`requirements.txt` is UTF-16 with CRLF** (a PowerShell `pip freeze` artefact). pip copes; other tools may not. Preserve the encoding when editing it.

**Model properties are not queryset fields.** `Group.is_full` and `member_count` are Python properties. `.exclude(is_full=True)` raises `FieldError`, and annotating over a property name raises too. Count in the query and compare with `F()`.

**Django URL order matters.** `lobbies/stats/` must be declared before `lobbies/<lobby_id>/`, or `stats` is captured as a lobby id.

**Create serializers may omit `id`.** Several viewsets respond with the write serializer, giving clients no id back. Return the read serializer from `create()`.

**drei's `KeyboardControls` listens on the window** and does not exclude text fields. Anything reading it must ignore input while typing, or chat drives the player. `isTypingInField()` in `CampusWithBackend.jsx`.

**react-three-fiber aims the default camera at the origin.** A camera positioned directly above the origin ends up looking straight down.

**`utils/api.js` is a fetch client that returns parsed JSON**, not an axios `{data}` envelope. Do not destructure `.data` from it. Note `services/api.js` is a *different*, axios-based client.

**Emoji in `print()` crashes on Windows** under cp1252. Use logging.

## 3D assets

Almost everything in the campus is generated in code. What is not is listed
here, and these are the decisions it is built on.

**Models are built from packs, and only the output is committed.** The packs are
tens of megabytes and live nobody-knows-where; the built `.glb` is small and
lives in `frontend/public`. Re-running a build script is a deliberate act, not
part of `bun run build`.

- `scripts/build-avatars.mjs` — rigged characters, from Quaternius's Ultimate
  Modular Men and Women. Keeps 6 of the 24 clips and strips weapons.
- `scripts/build-props.mjs` — static props, from Ultimate Nature Pack (2019).
  Reads OBJ, because that pack has no glTF and its materials are flat `Kd`
  colours with no texture maps, which is what the rest of the campus looks like.
  The newer Stylized Nature pack *does* ship glTF and is textured — bark
  normals, leaf alpha, a megabyte per species — which is the wrong style and the
  wrong budget.

**No mesh compression, and none needed.** The whole outdoor prop set — four
trees, two bushes, two rocks — is 400 KB uncompressed, less than half of one
avatar. Draco or Meshopt would each add a decoder to fetch before anything
renders, to save a couple of hundred kilobytes. Revisit if the props ever pass
about 3 MB; until then the budget is the mechanism.

**Everything repeated is instanced, and the numbers are measured, not guessed.**
`RenderProbe` (`?probe=1` on the campus, development only) walks the camera to
fixed viewpoints and reads `gl.info.render.calls`, leaving the result on
`window.__campusProbe`. Quote before and after when a change adds anything to
the scene.

Baseline, at 1440×900 on `main`, no models:

| viewpoint | draw calls | triangles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spawn | 425 | 45.8k |
| quad-north | 393 | 41.0k |
| spine-south | 454 | 50.7k |

**Draw calls are the metric that has bitten this project; triangles are the one
that bites phones.** Everything outdoors as it ships — 150 trees of four
species, 90 bushes, 40 rocks and the street planting — measures **444 draw
calls and 339.4k triangles** at the spawn, against 425 and 45.8k for the
procedural version it replaced. `?trees=drawn` still renders the old one, which
is how that was decided.

The four tree species carry 3, 4, 2 and 3 primitives, so the campus scatter is
twelve instanced meshes however many trees are in it, and the street planting
three more.

**There are two tree scatters, and they are in different files.** The campus
grounds are `CampusProps` in `CampusScenery`; the street planting along Nizami
Street is `StreetTrees` in `NizamiDistrict`. Changing one and not the other
leaves half the trees looking like the old ones, which is exactly what
happened. Both draw models now — the campus mixes four species, the street uses
one, because a municipality plants one tree down a road.

Indoors the win is the other way round. The cafeteria drew sixteen tables and
sixty-four chairs as separate objects — 464 meshes, computed from the
components rather than measured, because reaching an interior with the probe
means walking there. (`Table` is five meshes and `Chair` six: the legs are
inside a `.map`, so counting JSX tags undercounts them, which is how this was
first written down as 448.) As two instanced models that is four draw calls,
and the sixty-fifth chair is free.

**Furniture and the seat it carries must read the same constants.** A seat says
where a player is put; the model says where the furniture looks. Stated twice
they drift, and the player sits in mid-air — which happened to the entrance
hall's benches, three metres apart for months.

## Deployment

Coolify on a Hetzner VPS, not from CI. `ci.yml` runs tests and a frontend build only. Do not add a deploy step to it.

Config lives in Coolify environment variables, not in the repo. `settings.py` reads `SECRET_KEY`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DJANGO_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `NUM_PROXIES` and the `LIVEKIT_*` values from the environment.

**Rate limiting counts hops, so `NUM_PROXIES` has to match the deployment.**
DRF identifies a caller by address, and unset it uses the whole
`X-Forwarded-For` header — which the caller writes and Traefik appends to
rather than replaces, so anybody could rotate a made-up value and get a fresh
budget for every attempt. Coolify puts one Traefik in front of the container,
so it is 1. Putting another proxy in front — Cloudflare in proxy mode — makes
it 2.

Both ways of getting it wrong bite, and not symmetrically. DRF counts back from
the *end* of the header, so **too high** reads too far left, into the part the
caller wrote: at `2` against one real proxy, `X-Forwarded-For: FAKE, <client>`
resolves to `FAKE` and identities rotate freely. **Too low** reads too far
right, into the proxies: at `1` behind Cloudflare, every caller resolves to
Cloudflare's address and shares one bucket, so one person guessing passwords
locks out everybody. Negative is worse than either — DRF indexes past the end
of the header and every throttled request raises `IndexError`, so `settings.py`
refuses to start rather than turning sign-in into a 500.

**The real client address reaches the logs through `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`.**
uvicorn runs with `--proxy-headers`, so it takes the client from
`X-Forwarded-For` rather than the TCP peer, which behind Traefik is always the
proxy: every access log line used to read `172.18.0.x`. Which addresses may be
trusted to send that header is uvicorn's own environment variable, set per
deployment, so the range is not baked into the image. Unset it defaults to
`127.0.0.1`, trusts nothing and logs the proxy, which is the behaviour this
replaced.

Never set it to `*`. With a trusted list uvicorn walks the header in reverse
and takes the first host it does not trust, which is the one Traefik appended.
With `*` it takes the leftmost entry instead, which the caller writes, so
anybody could put whatever they liked in your logs.

This does not touch rate limiting. DRF reads `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` itself and
counts back `NUM_PROXIES` hops from the end; `--proxy-headers` only rewrites
the ASGI client, which becomes `REMOTE_ADDR`, and leaves the header alone.

## Releases

Push a tag beginning with `v` and `release.yml` publishes a GitHub release for
it. It deploys nothing — Coolify still does that from the server.

The notes are built by `.github/scripts/release_notes.py` from the commits
between this tag and the one before it.

Sections come from the conventional-commit **type** — `feat` becomes "New",
`fix` becomes "What was wrong", `perf` "Faster", and so on. The **scope** is
not a section: it labels each line (`campus` reads as "Campus simulator") and
is tallied under "Where the work went". A commit whose subject is not
conventional is still listed, under "Everything else", rather than dropped.

Then the numbers, and who wrote it. It welcomes anybody whose first commit is
in that range, matched on email address rather than name — the same person
appears here as both `Martian` and `martian56`.

Its tests run in CI, on every pull request, because a release happens once and
whatever it produces is what people read. A tag with a hyphen in the version
(`v1.2.0-rc.1`) publishes as a pre-release. Re-running the workflow on a tag
updates the notes rather than failing.

## Working style

- Branch off `main`; the repository has branch protection and expects pull requests.
- Commit messages explain **why**. For a bug, describe the behaviour that was wrong.
- Keep changes focused. Unrelated refactoring makes review and revert harder.
- Commit the migration alongside a model change.
- Verify before claiming. Run the tests, check the browser, and say what you actually did, including what you could not verify.

## Hosting analytics

Traffic comes from nginx's own access logs, not from anything in the user's
site. `hosting/nginx/hosting.conf` writes one JSON object per request to
`/var/log/hosting/access.log` — a bind mount the Django resource also sees, and
deliberately outside the webroot, because anything under `/var/www/html` is
servable and `logs.ufazien.com` would have handed out every visitor's address.

`manage.py aggregate_access_logs` rolls those into one `WebsiteAnalytics` row
per site per day. Run it on a timer. Everything it writes is an absolute total,
so running it twice changes nothing — and it refuses to lower a day's figures
unless given `--force`, because a log that holds less than it did is rotation
rather than a quieter day.

`bounce_rate` and `avg_session_duration` stay at zero, honestly: a log line is a
request, not a session. They need a script on the page, which nothing serves.

One run fills three tables: `WebsiteAnalytics` (the pages), `BandwidthUsage`
(the quota) and `Website.total_visits` (the header, the dashboard total, and the
public listing's sort order). All three were read by something and written by
nothing.

Bandwidth is stored in **bytes**. `BandwidthUsage.bandwidth_mb` is a whole
number of megabytes and the sites here serve kilobytes a day: rounding down
records a real day as nothing, rounding up records 14 KB as a megabyte. Read
`bandwidth_bytes`; the megabyte column is kept for older readers.

Storage is separate and already worked: `manage.py compute_storage` measures
`/srv/hosting/<subdomain>` and writes `Website.storage_used_mb`. Run it on a
timer too.

**Referrers are stored as an origin, never a full URL.** A `Referer` carries
the whole address of the page somebody came from, and that page belongs to a
different site than the one being reported to — its path and query can hold a
reset token, an unsubscribe link or somebody's email address. Keeping only
scheme and host is the same rule as the one about emails in `community`:
somebody else's identifier must not reach a site owner. `scrub_referrers`
reduces rows written before that rule.

`webhooks/analytics/` is signed with `HOSTING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and identifies a
site by subdomain. A subdomain says which site a payload is about and nothing
about who sent it, so without the signature anybody could post any figures for
anybody's site. Unset, the endpoint refuses everything rather than accepting
anything.
