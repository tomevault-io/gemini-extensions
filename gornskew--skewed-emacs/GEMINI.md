# Skewed Emacs + Gendl Docker Development Environment

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the integrated Skewed Emacs and Gendl development environment.

## Overview

This setup provides a complete Lisp development environment with:
- **Skewed Emacs Container**: Custom Emacs configuration with MCP integration
- **Gendl Container**: 3D CAD/modeling system with Common Lisp REPL and MCP integration
- **Network Integration**: Containers communicate via Docker network for SLIME connections
- **MCP Services**: Both containers expose services via Model Context Protocol for external tool integration

## MCP Integration

The containers are now wrapped as MCP (Model Context Protocol) services, providing seamless integration with Claude Code and other MCP-enabled tools.

### Available MCP Services

**Emacs Lisp Evaluation Service:**
- **Service Name**: `mcp__skewed-emacs__skewed-emacs__lisp_eval`
- **Purpose**: Evaluate Emacs Lisp code remotely
- **Usage**: `mcp__skewed-emacs__skewed-emacs__lisp_eval(code="(+ 1 2 3)")`

**Gendl Common Lisp Services (included with skewed-emacs):**
- `mcp__gendl_ccl__gendl_ccl__lisp_eval` — Gendl on Clozure CL (port 9080)
- `mcp__gendl_sbcl__gendl_sbcl__lisp_eval` — Gendl on SBCL (port 9090)

**Commercial Genworks GDL Services (via supplemental overlay repos):**
- `mcp__genworks_gdl_smp__genworks_gdl_smp__lisp_eval` — GDL with NURBS (port 9098)
- `mcp__genworks_gdl_enterprise_smp__genworks_gdl_enterprise_smp__lisp_eval` — Enterprise variant
- These are not included in skewed-emacs. Licensed users receive a supplemental
  repo to clone as a sibling directory, then run its `./install` script to
  add Docker Compose and MCP config overlays into skewed-emacs.

**Ping Services:**
- `mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__ping_lisp` - Check Emacs availability
- `mcp__gendl_ccl__gendl_ccl__ping_lisp` - Check Gendl CCL availability
- `mcp__gendl_sbcl__gendl_sbcl__ping_lisp` - Check Gendl SBCL availability

### MCP vs Raw HTTP

**Previous Approach (Deprecated):**
```bash
# Raw HTTP calls (no longer recommended)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7080/lisply/lisp-eval -d '{"code": "(+ 1 2 3)"}'  # only from inside container
```

**Current Approach (Recommended):**
```python
# Through MCP services (seamless with Claude Code)
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__lisp_eval(code="(+ 1 2 3)")
```


### Verification Commands

Check if workarounds are active:
```bash
# Test current environment via MCP
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__lisp_eval(code='(list (getenv "SHELL") shell-file-name (getenv "PATH"))')

# Test native compilation settings
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__lisp_eval(code='native-comp-jit-compilation')

# Test assembler accessibility
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__lisp_eval(code='(shell-command-to-string "which as")')
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Environment

```bash
# Navigate to skewed-emacs directory
cd ~/projects/skewed-emacs

# Start the full container stack
./compose-dev up

# Verify services are running via MCP
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__ping_lisp()      # Should return "pong"
mcp__gendl_ccl__gendl_ccl__ping_lisp()            # Should return "pong"
```

### 2. Connect to Development Environment

```bash
# Connect to Emacs in the container
docker exec -it skewed-emacs emacsclient -t

# From within Emacs, connect to Gendl SLIME
# M-x slime-connect RET gendl-ccl RET 4200 RET
```

## Container Details

### Skewed Emacs Container (`skewed-emacs`)
- **Base**: Custom Emacs configuration
- **Network Name**: `skewed-emacs` (accessible as `skewed-emacs:7080` from other containers)
- **Host Ports**: 
- `6942` → `6942` (ttyd web terminal)
- **MCP Service**: Available via `mcp__skewed-emacs__*` functions
- **Mount**: `~/projects` → `/projects`

### Gendl/GDL Containers

**Included with skewed-emacs** (free, open-source Gendl kernel):

| Container | Image | HTTP Port | Swank Port |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| `gendl-ccl` | `genworks/gendl:devo-ccl` | 9080 (host: 19080) | 4200 |
| `gendl-sbcl` | `genworks/gendl:devo-sbcl` | 9090 (host: 29080) | 4210 |

**Available via supplemental overlay repos** (licensed, commercial GDL with NURBS):

| Container | HTTP Port | Swank Port |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| `genworks-gdl-smp` | 9098 | 4218 |
| `genworks-gdl-non-smp` | 9089 | 4209 |
| `genworks-gdl-enterprise-smp` | 9098 | 4218 |

Licensed users clone their supplemental repo as a sibling to `skewed-emacs/`,
run `./install`, then `./compose-dev up` picks up the overlay automatically.

All containers mount `~/projects` → `/projects` and join `skewed-network`.
Check the Dashboard (`*dashboard*` buffer) for current service health.

### Docker Network
- **Network Name**: `skewed-network`
- **Purpose**: Enables container-to-container communication
- **Key Benefit**: Allows SLIME connection from Skewed Emacs to Gendl Swank server

## Development Workflow

### 1. Basic SLIME Development
```elisp
;; In Skewed Emacs container, after slime-connect to gendl-ccl:4200
;; Load Quicklisp
(load-quicklisp)

;; Add project directories
(pushnew "~/projects/gendl/demos/" ql:*local-project-directories* :test #'equalp)

;; Enable development mode
(setq gwl:*developing?* t)

;; Load systems
(ql:quickload :wire-world)
(ql:quickload :bus)
```

### 2. MCP API Development  
```python
# Test Gendl MCP service
result = mcp__gendl_ccl__gendl_ccl__lisp_eval(code="(+ 1 2 3)")

# Test Emacs MCP service
result = mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__lisp_eval(code="(+ 1 2 3)")

# Test connectivity
gendl_status = mcp__gendl_ccl__gendl_ccl__ping_lisp()
emacs_status = mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__ping_lisp()
```

### 3. Monitoring Claude Code Activity
With MCP services running, you can monitor what Claude Code or other agents are doing:

```bash
# Watch Emacs activities
docker logs -f skewed-emacs

# Watch Gendl activities  
docker logs -f gendl-ccl

# Or from within Emacs, watch the *Messages* buffer for API calls
```

## MCP API Usage

For detailed MCP API documentation, examples, and best practices, see:
**`dot-files/emacs.d/sideloaded/lisply-backend/CLAUDE.md`**

### Quick MCP API Reference
```python
# Basic evaluation
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__lisp_eval(code="(+ 1 2 3)")

# File editing (see lisply-backend docs for detailed patterns)
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__lisp_eval(code='(find-file "/path/to/file.lisp")')

# Test connectivity
mcp__skewed_emacs__skewed_emacs__ping_lisp()
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING**: When using MCP file editing, you share the **global current buffer** with the user. Always use `with-current-buffer` patterns to avoid conflicts. See lisply-backend documentation for safe practices.

## File Editing via MCP

# Create network (one-time)
docker network create skewed-network

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop containers
docker stop skewed-emacs gendl-ccl

# Remove containers
docker rm skewed-emacs gendl-ccl

# Remove network
docker network rm skewed-network
```

### Development Commands

gendl_result = mcp__gendl_ccl__gendl_ccl__lisp_eval(code="(+ 1 2 3)")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP services not responding**:
   - Check if containers are running: `docker ps`
   - Verify MCP wrapper is configured correctly
   - Check container logs: `docker logs <container-name>`

2. **Containers not communicating**:
   - Ensure both containers are on the same network: `docker network ls`
   - Check container names: `docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Networks}}"`

3. **SLIME connection fails**:
   - Verify Swank is running: `docker exec gendl-ccl netstat -an | grep 4200`
   - Check network connectivity: `docker exec skewed-emacs telnet gendl-ccl 4200`

4. **Mount issues**:
   - Ensure `~/projects` exists on host
   - Check permissions: `ls -la ~/projects`

### Reset Environment
```bash
# Stop and remove everything
cd ~/projects/skewed-emacs
./compose-dev down

# Recreate from scratch
./compose-dev up
```

## Integration with Claude Code

This environment is designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code:

1. **MCP Service Access**: Claude Code can use MCP services directly without HTTP calls
2. **File System Access**: Both containers mount `~/projects` for shared file access
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Use `docker exec` to connect to Emacs and watch Claude's activities
4. **Development Feedback Loop**: Edit files, test with Claude, see results in real-time

### Example Claude Code Workflow
```python
# Claude makes changes via MCP services
result = mcp__gendl_ccl__gendl_ccl__lisp_eval(code='(ql:quickload :my-project)')

# You can see the results in your SLIME session
# And use Update! links in Gendl web interface for live reloading
```

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- MCP services allow arbitrary Lisp evaluation
- Only use in trusted, containerized environments
- Do not expose services to untrusted networks

### Data Types
- All results are returned as strings (using `format "%s"`)
- Complex Lisp data structures maintain their textual representation
- Boolean values: `t` for true, `nil` for false

### Error Handling
- Syntax errors and runtime errors are caught and returned in result
- MCP services provide consistent error reporting

## Lessons Learned (March 2026 Session)

### Reading SLIME REPL Buffers via MCP
When reading `*slime-repl allegro<N>*` buffers from MCP:
- **Use `(buffer-string)`** — this works reliably
- **Do NOT use `(buffer-substring-no-properties ...)`** — returns empty strings for SLIME REPL buffers
- **Send commands**: `(with-current-buffer "*slime-repl allegro<2>*" (goto-char (point-max)) (insert "(your-form)") (slime-repl-return))`
- **Read SLDB debugger buffers**: `(with-current-buffer "*sldb allegro<2>/N*" (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (min 2000 (point-max))))`
- **Abort debugger**: `(with-current-buffer "*sldb allegro<2>/N*" (sldb-abort))`
- **Avoid `sleep-for` between send and read** — timing is unreliable, just read the buffer and check for a prompt

### File Creation Through Emacs When /projects/ Is Not Directly Writable
Claude's scratch container cannot write to `/projects/`. Create files through Emacs:
```elisp
;; Write initial content
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert "file header...")
  (write-region (point-min) (point-max) "/projects/path/to/new-file.lisp"))

;; Append more content
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert "more content...")
  (append-to-file (point-min) (point-max) "/projects/path/to/new-file.lisp"))
```
This avoids triple-escaping issues when content contains strings with quotes (e.g., JSON in CL).

### Modern-Mode Allegro CL: Case Sensitivity
`genworks-gdl-enterprise-smp` runs modern-mode Allegro CL with `(readtable-case *readtable*)` → `:preserve`.
- Keywords are case-sensitive: `:email` ≠ `:EMAIL`
- When interning strings as keywords, do NOT upcase: `(intern key :keyword)` not `(intern (string-upcase key) :keyword)`
- This affects JSON parsing, property access, and any dynamic symbol creation

### `kill-sexp` for Balanced Replacements
The most reliable pattern for replacing a sexp in Emacs:
```elisp
(goto-char (point-min))
(search-forward "(defun target-function")
(beginning-of-line)
(kill-sexp)
(insert "(defun target-function () ...new balanced body...)")
```
This is safer than region-based deletion because `kill-sexp` guarantees structural correctness.

### AllegroServe: Symbol Names to Know
- `*response-method-not-allowed*` (NOT `*response-not-allowed*`)
- Use `(do-external-symbols ...)` to discover available symbols when unsure
- `gwl:with-all-servers` iterates over `gwl:*http-server*` and `gwl:*https-server*`
- Use `gwl:*http-server*` not `net.aserve:*wserver*` (Franz commandeered the default for their web IDE)

### `*print-readably*` in Error Handlers
Allegro CL's `dumplisp` and build processes can produce conditions containing unprintable objects (byte arrays).
Always bind `*print-readably*` to nil in error handlers:
```lisp
(handler-case (risky-operation)
  (error (c)
    (let ((*print-readably* nil))
      (format t "Error: ~a" c))))
```

## Version History

- **Initial Setup**: Basic container configuration
- **Network Integration**: Added Docker network for container communication
- **SLIME Integration**: Enabled seamless Emacs-to-Gendl SLIME connections
- **HTTP API Setup**: Both containers expose HTTP APIs for external tool integration
- **MCP Migration**: Transitioned from raw HTTP to MCP services for better integration


## Development Lessons Learned

**For detailed lessons learned including:**
- **Shared current buffer footgun and solutions**
- String escaping and code generation best practices
- Interactive prompt handling
- Successful MCP file editing workflows
- Paredit mode workflows
- Error recovery patterns

**See: `dot-files/emacs.d/sideloaded/lisply-backend/CLAUDE.md`**

### Key Takeaway: Shared Buffer State
When using MCP file editing, remember that you **share the global current buffer** with the user. This was discovered during viewport menu development when buffer switching conflicts occurred. Always use explicit buffer targeting with `with-current-buffer` patterns.

### Quick Reference: Safe Patterns
```elisp
;; BAD: Relies on global current buffer
(search-forward "target")

;; GOOD: Explicit buffer targeting
(with-current-buffer "specific-file.lisp"
  (search-forward "target"))
```


## Emacs-Native Tool Preference

**Prefer Emacs native tools over shell commands:**

| Task | Prefer | Avoid |
|------|--------|-------|
| File listing | `(dired-noselect "/path/")` | `(shell-command-to-string "ls")` |
| Git status | `(magit-status)` or `(vc-dir)` | `(shell-command-to-string "git status")` |
| File operations | `(rename-file)`, `(copy-file)` | `(shell-command "mv ...")` |
| Search in files | `(grep-find)`, `(project-find-regexp)` | `(shell-command "grep ...")` |

**Always refresh stale buffers before consulting:**
```elisp
;; Dired: refresh before reading
(with-current-buffer (dired-noselect "/projects/skewed-emacs/")
  (revert-buffer)  ;; Same as pressing 'g' interactively
  ...)

;; File buffers: revert if file changed on disk
(with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect "/path/to/file")
  (when (not (verify-visited-file-modtime (current-buffer)))
    (revert-buffer t t t))
  ...)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Native Emacs tools integrate with the shared buffer state
- Shell commands bypass Emacs's knowledge of file system state
- Dired buffers can become stale; always `(revert-buffer)` before trusting contents


## Critical Best Practices for Claude (Learned 2026-01-04)

### File Path Confusion - Always Use MCP
**WRONG**: Assuming files are in `/mnt/project` (Claude.ai container filesystem)
**RIGHT**: Files in Dave's projects are at `/projects/apps/...` and accessed via skewed-emacs MCP

Example:
```elisp
;; WRONG - trying to use local filesystem
(with-temp-file "/mnt/project/assembly.lisp" ...)

;; RIGHT - use MCP to access Dave's environment
(with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect "/projects/apps/tw-site-2025/source/assembly.lisp")
  ...)
```

**Rule**: If you find yourself creating files in `/home/claude/`, you're doing it wrong. Use skewed-emacs MCP.

### Minibuffer Blocking Issue
**Symptom**: All MCP calls suddenly fail with connectivity errors
**Cause**: Emacs is waiting for minibuffer input (e.g., "File changed on disk. Discard edits? (yes or no)")
**Solution**: Alert Dave that Emacs needs input before continuing

### Incremental Editing > Wholesale Replacement
**WRONG**: Using `with-temp-file` to rewrite entire complex files
```elisp
(with-temp-file "/path/to/file.lisp"
  (insert "entire new file..."))  ;; Often creates unbalanced parens!
```

**RIGHT**: Make targeted edits with structural navigation
```elisp
(with-current-buffer "file.lisp"
  (when (fboundp 'paredit-mode) (paredit-mode 1))
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (search-forward "string-to-find")
    (search-backward "opening-quote")
    (kill-sexp)
    (insert "replacement"))
  (check-parens)
  (save-buffer))
```

### When Structural Editing Fails
If you're stuck in unbalanced buffer hell:
1. Ask Dave to revert the file: `git checkout path/to/file`
2. Ask Dave to create a placeholder comment where you can insert balanced content
3. Insert the content into the placeholder position

Example workflow that works:
```elisp
;; Dave creates placeholder in buffer:
;;
;; Insert balanced lhtml body here
;;

;; Claude inserts at that position:
(goto-char (point-min))
(search-forward ";; Insert balanced lhtml body here")
(beginning-of-line)
(kill-line 3)  ;; Remove comment
(insert "balanced content...")
```

### LHTML Format (for GDL Web Projects)

GDL uses `with-lhtml-string` for HTML generation. Two syntaxes exist:

**OLD htmlgen compatibility format (extra parens):**
```lisp
((:a :href "url" :class "style") "Link Text")
```

**NEW lhtml native format (cleaner, preferred for new code):**
```lisp
(:a :href "url" :class "style" "Link Text")
```

Use the native format for new code in tw-site-2025 and similar projects.
