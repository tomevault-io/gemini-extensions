# AGENTS.md

This file defines how automated agents (Codex, Claude, chat-based coding agents, CI bots, etc.) should operate inside this monorepo.

The repo contains multiple subprojects with different languages, runtimes, and constraints. **Do not assume one “global” build/run workflow applies everywhere.** Instead:

1. **Identify the target subproject(s)** from the user prompt and/or file paths you’re asked to touch.
2. Follow the **Monorepo-wide rules** below.
3. Then apply the matching **Subproject playbook** (e.g., `volume-cartographer/`, `vesuvius/`) only if the prompt targets it.

---

## 1) Monorepo-wide rules

### 1.0 Portal startup policy (important)
- Treat discovery/exploration runs as **read-only** unless the user explicitly asks for environment setup.
- **Do not run installation/bootstrap commands by default** when starting work in this repo.
- Skip side-effect scripts until explicitly requested by the user:
  - `build_dependencies.sh`
  - `install_dependencies.sh`
  - `install_repositories.sh`
  - `setup_user.sh`
  - `setup_sudo.sh`
  - `npm install`, `yarn install`, `pip install`, `poetry install`, `conda env` creation, `uv sync`, Docker build/pull
- If dependencies are needed, report the exact minimal install command per target subproject and ask for confirmation.
- For agent-mode runs (Codex/CI), skip install/bootstrap side effects unless explicitly allowed:
  - Set `AGENTS_AGENT_MODE=1` for that session/run.
  - Then explicitly set `AGENTS_ALLOW_INSTALL=1` to run installs.
- For local/manual usage, no extra env var is required; run installs directly.

### 1.1 Scope first, then act
- Treat each top-level folder as an independent product unless proven otherwise.
- Make the smallest change that solves the requested task.
- If the task spans multiple subprojects, split your work into clearly separated commits/patches.
- Do not execute setup, install, or build scripts in non-target subprojects.

### 1.2 Don’t guess build systems or dependencies
Before changing code:
- Look for **subproject-local** docs and scripts:
  - `README*`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `Makefile`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`
- Prefer **existing scripts** over inventing new commands.
- If the target subproject is not explicit, ask the user once for scope before running any install/build/discovery script.

### 1.3 Default to correctness and reproducibility
Unless the prompt explicitly says otherwise:
- Preserve behavior and outputs.
- Avoid nondeterminism (race conditions, unordered iteration affecting results, data-loader shuffles without fixed seeds, etc.).
- Avoid changes that silently relax numerical guarantees, precision, or error bounds.

### 1.4 Performance work must be measured
If the prompt is about performance:
- Establish a baseline.
- Use a profiler appropriate for the platform and language.
- Report before/after results with:
  - command line
  - dataset/input
  - build type
  - iteration counts and summary stats (mean + p50/p95 or min/median/max)

### 1.5 Portability is a hard requirement
The repo targets **Ubuntu and macOS**, across **amd64 and arm64** (where applicable).
- Avoid OS-specific code without guards.
- If adding SIMD/intrinsics, gate it and provide a safe fallback.
- Avoid toolchain-specific flags unless justified and documented.

### 1.6 Keep changes reviewable
- Prefer small, focused diffs.
- Avoid large refactors unless the prompt explicitly requests them.
- If you must refactor, do it in two steps:
  1) mechanical refactor with no behavior change
  2) functional/performance change with measurements

### 1.7 Tests are not optional
- Run the subproject’s tests (or at minimum its smoke/run steps) before claiming success.
- If no tests exist for the touched logic, add a minimal regression test or a lightweight validation harness.

---

## 2) How to decide which playbook to use

Use a subproject playbook when **any** of the following is true:
- The user prompt names the folder (e.g., “work on `volume-cartographer`”).
- The files you’re editing are under that folder.
- You’re asked to run a binary/script that clearly belongs to that folder.

If the prompt is ambiguous:
- Start by mapping the repo structure and identifying candidate entrypoints.
- Propose a plan that separates “discovery” from “changes”.
- Avoid risky changes until scope is clear.

---

## 3) Subproject playbooks

### 3.1 `volume-cartographer/` playbook (activate only when prompted)

**What it is (from repo context):**
- A CPU-based computational geometry / volumetric pipeline project.
- **Language:** C++
- **Build:** CMake
- **Key script:** `volume-cartographer/scripts/build_dependencies.sh` is the source of truth for dependencies.
- **Platforms:** Ubuntu + macOS, amd64 + arm64
- **Current optimization constraint (from prompt context):** focus on speedups **without numeric changes**.

#### Build & test (discover actual entrypoint first)
1) Read and follow:
   - `volume-cartographer/scripts/build_dependencies.sh`
2) Locate the correct CMake entrypoint:
   - repo root `CMakeLists.txt` vs `volume-cartographer/CMakeLists.txt`
3) Prefer:
   - `RelWithDebInfo` for profiling
   - `Release` for final performance numbers
4) Export compile commands where possible:
   - `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`

#### Performance constraints (strict)
- **No numeric changes**:
  - no `-ffast-math`, `-Ofast`, “fast” approximations, reduced precision, epsilon relaxations, etc.
- Avoid nondeterminism in results:
  - be careful with parallelism and iteration order changes
- Favor improvements that preserve exact math:
  - fewer allocations
  - better cache locality / data layout
  - pruning and early-out logic that is mathematically equivalent
  - algorithmic broad-phase that does not change accepted/rejected sets

#### Workload inputs
- A representative dataset may be provided as `<folder.volpkg>`.
- Treat that as the canonical perf workload unless instructed otherwise.

#### Required deliverables for perf PRs
- Profiler hotspot summary (top functions by time)
- Before/after benchmark table (command, dataset, build type, iterations)
- Explanation of why numerics are unchanged
- Minimal regression test or validation step if the hotspot lacked coverage

---

### 3.2 `vesuvius/` playbook (activate only when prompted)

**What it is (from repo context):**
- Deep Learning pipelines for **3D computer vision**.

Because ML stacks vary, **do not assume** the framework or environment manager. You must detect it from repo files.

#### Environment & reproducibility
1) Identify environment definition:
   - `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `environment.yml`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Dockerfile`, etc.
2) Follow project-provided commands/scripts for setup and running.
3) Preserve reproducibility by default:
   - fixed seeds where used
   - stable evaluation protocols
   - avoid silently changing preprocessing, augmentations, normalization, or label semantics

#### Performance and “speedups” in ML context
Unless the prompt allows numerical changes, do **not**:
- change model precision (fp32 → fp16/bf16)
- change kernels, quantization, approximations
- change batch sizing or input resolution to “cheat” throughput

Safe speedups (often no numeric change) can include:
- removing data-loading bottlenecks (caching, prefetching, pinned memory where applicable)
- reducing redundant preprocessing
- improving I/O (sharding, memory mapping) while preserving exact bytes/values
- eliminating unnecessary tensor copies/conversions
- batching and vectorizing CPU-side preprocessing deterministically

#### Required deliverables for ML changes
- Exact run command(s) used
- Metric comparison (before/after) for correctness-sensitive changes
- Throughput/latency measurements (before/after) for performance work
- Notes about determinism/reproducibility impact

---

### 3.3 Template playbook for other subprojects (fill in when you encounter them)

When the prompt targets a different folder, create a mini playbook in your notes (or extend this file if requested) with:

- **Folder:** `<name>/`
- **Purpose:** what the subproject does
- **Language(s):** `<...>`
- **Build/run:** `<commands or scripts>`
- **Tests:** `<how to run>`
- **Platforms:** `<os/arch constraints>`
- **Non-negotiable constraints:** `<numerics, determinism, backwards compatibility, etc.>`
- **Typical inputs/datasets:** `<paths, formats>`
- **Perf protocol (if relevant):** `<how to measure>`

---

## 4) Cross-cutting implementation guidelines

### 4.1 Avoid “hidden” behavior changes
Even if output files look similar, changes in:
- iteration order
- concurrency scheduling
- floating-point accumulation order
- dataset shuffling
can alter results. Keep this stable unless explicitly allowed.

### 4.2 Prefer clear, local improvements
High-ROI improvements that are usually safe across projects:
- eliminate repeated allocations in hot loops
- reuse buffers
- improve data locality (SoA, contiguous arrays)
- reduce needless copies and conversions
- hoist invariants out of loops
- add early-outs that are logically equivalent

### 4.3 Document anything that affects developer workflow
If you add:
- new scripts
- new dependencies
- new benchmark harnesses
document how to use them and how they’re validated.

---

## 5) What to include in your final response (agent output format)

When you complete a task, include:
- **What you changed** (files + brief rationale)
- **How to build and run** (exact commands)
- **How you verified** (tests + dataset/inputs)
- **Perf results** (if applicable) with before/after numbers and methodology
- **Risks/limitations** (what might break on other OS/arch or edge cases)

---

## 6) Quick reminder: when to be specific

- If the prompt says “work on `volume-cartographer`”: apply §3.1.
- If it says “work on `vesuvius`”: apply §3.2.
- If it names another folder: create a lightweight playbook using §3.3 and proceed cautiously.
