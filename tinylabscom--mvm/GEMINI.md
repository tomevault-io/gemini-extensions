## mvm

> All Nix builds, Firecracker operations, `mvmctl` runtime commands (anything that boots, talks to, or manages microVMs), and Linux-specific syscalls MUST be run inside the Lima VM. Use `limactl shell mvm-builder -- <command>` to execute commands inside the VM. The Lima VM name is `mvm-builder` (renamed from `mvm` in W7.2).

# Agent Working Agreement

## Lima VM Requirement

All Nix builds, Firecracker operations, `mvmctl` runtime commands (anything that boots, talks to, or manages microVMs), and Linux-specific syscalls MUST be run inside the Lima VM. Use `limactl shell mvm-builder -- <command>` to execute commands inside the VM. The Lima VM name is `mvm-builder` (renamed from `mvm` in W7.2).

**Run cargo on the macOS host wherever it compiles cleanly.** `cargo test`, `cargo check`, and `cargo build` should default to the host so worktrees don't deadlock on the single shared Lima VM (cargo target-dir contention, registry locks, and `.git/index` cross-mount races are real and have caused us to lose work). Tests that genuinely need Linux — vsock, jailer/seccomp, dm-verity, network namespaces, anything that pokes at `/dev/kvm` or `/proc/net` — should be gated with `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` and only those sub-targets are run inside Lima. Workspace-wide `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` is still expected to pass inside Lima before merge, since clippy needs to see the Linux-gated code paths.

**git only runs from the main `mvm/` checkout, never from inside a worktree directory and never from inside Lima.** The main checkout is the single git operator for the whole repo. To act on a worktree's branch, use `git -C /path/to/.worktrees/mvm-<slug> <cmd>` from the main checkout — that drives the worktree's index/HEAD/refs while keeping the running git process anchored at the main checkout. Reasons: (1) only one git process at a time touches `.git/objects`, `.git/packed-refs`, and the shared `.git/hooks/` invocation context, eliminating the cross-worktree contention that has caused us to lose work; (2) the 9p/virtiofs share with Lima does not share git's lock semantics, so git from inside Lima deadlocks against host-side git. Cargo/nix/firecracker/mvmctl commands still run from each worktree's own directory — only `git` is centralized.

If the Lima VM is not running, boot it with:

```bash
cargo run -- dev
```

Once running, access it with:

```bash
limactl shell mvm-builder
```

Examples:
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- cargo run --quiet -- build openclaw --force`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- cargo run --quiet -- up --manifest openclaw --name oc`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- cargo run --quiet -- logs oc`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- cargo run --quiet -- down oc`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- nix build .#packages.aarch64-linux.default`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- nix path-info -rsh /nix/store/<hash>`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- cargo test --workspace`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`
- `limactl shell mvm-builder -- cargo check --workspace`

**Important:** `mvmctl` (via `cargo run`) commands like `build`, `up`, `down`, `logs`, and `ls` must be run inside the Lima VM — they talk to Firecracker which only runs inside Linux. `cargo test` / `cargo check` / `cargo build` should run on the macOS host by default (see "Run cargo on the macOS host" above); only `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` and tests gated on `target_os = "linux"` need Lima. `cargo run -- dev` always runs on the macOS host directly.

## Worktree Workflow for Features

Every feature, refactor, or non-trivial bug fix is developed in a git worktree — code edits and cargo invocations happen inside the worktree directory. Git operations (status, add, commit, stash, rebase, push, fetch, pull, hook execution) happen from the main `mvm/` checkout, with `-C` pointing at the worktree when needed. The main checkout is the single git operator; worktree directories are code+build sandboxes only.

### Never commit directly to `main`

`main` is updated only via merged pull requests — never by `git commit` against the local `main` branch, even from the main checkout, even for docs-only changes, even with `--no-verify`. Reasons:

- **Safety against parallel agents.** Multiple agents share `.git/`. Any agent that pulls/rebases/`reset --hard origin/main` (a routine recovery move) silently discards local-only commits on main. Branches that exist on `origin` cannot be wiped this way.
- **CI gating.** The full clippy + nextest + supply-chain + flake-check matrix only runs on PRs. A direct commit ships untested.
- **Audit trail.** PR descriptions, CI status, review comments, and merge events form the project's history. A local commit pushed to main loses all of it.

If you have changes intended for `main`, push them to a branch and open a PR — even a one-line typo fix. The repo's GitHub settings are not branch-protected, so the convention is the only thing keeping main clean.

The only `git` commands that should ever target `main` directly are read-only (`git log main`, `git show main:path`) or routine sync (`git fetch origin`, `git pull --ff-only origin main`).

### Creating the worktree

All worktrees live in a `.worktrees/` directory that sits as a sibling of the main checkout — never directly next to the main checkout. This keeps the parent directory (which holds the rest of the ecosystem repos) free of feature-branch clutter and makes it obvious at a glance which directories are real repos vs. transient sandboxes.

From the main `mvm/` checkout:

```bash
cd /Users/auser/work/tinylabs/mvmco/mvm
mkdir -p ../.worktrees                # one-time, if it doesn't already exist
git worktree add ../.worktrees/mvm-<feature-slug> -b feat/<feature-slug>
```

Then switch terminals/agents into the worktree directory for code work:

```bash
cd ../.worktrees/mvm-<feature-slug>
# edit code, run cargo, run mvmctl from here
```

Branch names follow the existing pattern (`feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`).

### Doing git work for a worktree

Always from the main `mvm/` checkout, with `-C` pointing at the worktree:

```bash
cd /Users/auser/work/tinylabs/mvmco/mvm
git -C ../.worktrees/mvm-<feature-slug> status
git -C ../.worktrees/mvm-<feature-slug> add path/to/file
git -C ../.worktrees/mvm-<feature-slug> commit -m "..."
git -C ../.worktrees/mvm-<feature-slug> push -u origin feat/<feature-slug>
```

This serializes all git activity through one process and keeps `.git/objects`, `.git/packed-refs`, and the hooks dir from being touched by multiple agents at once. The pre-commit hook fires once per commit, in the main checkout — no concurrent-hook fan-out.

Agents working inside a worktree directory should not invoke `git` directly. If you need git state, ask the operator at the main checkout, or run a read-only `git -C <main-checkout> status` if you must.

### Isolating mutable state

Worktrees share `~/.mvm`, `~/.cache/mvm`, `~/.cargo`, `~/.rustup`, the Lima VM, the Nix store, and any pushed registries with the main checkout. Per-worktree isolation is achieved by overriding three env vars for the duration of a command:

```bash
MVM_DATA_DIR="$PWD/.mvm-test"      \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/.mvm-test/target" \
CARGO_HOME="$PWD/.mvm-test/cargo"  \
  cargo test --workspace
```

- `MVM_DATA_DIR` redirects mvmctl's templates, sockets, microVM registry, snapshots, and signing keys away from `~/.mvm`.
- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` gives the worktree its own `target/` so two worktrees compiling at once don't fight over output paths or rustc invocation locks.
- `CARGO_HOME` gives the worktree its own cargo registry/cache and (most importantly) its own `.package-cache` lock — without this, two concurrent `cargo test` invocations across worktrees serialize on `~/.cargo/registry/.package-cache` and one will block until the other finishes downloading or resolving.

Four things are committed to make this convenient:

- **`scripts/dev-env.sh`** exports all three vars (resolved relative to the worktree root, so it works from any subdir). Source it once at the top of a shell: `source scripts/dev-env.sh`.
- **`bin/dev`** is a wrapper that sources `scripts/dev-env.sh` and execs `cargo run --quiet -- "$@"`. Use it for any one-off `mvmctl` call: `bin/dev build`, `bin/dev exec ...`.
- **`just dev-test` / `just dev-clippy` / `just dev-check`** invoke cargo with the env sourced.
- **`.envrc.example`** sources `scripts/dev-env.sh` for direnv users (`cp .envrc.example .envrc && direnv allow`).

One-time per clone: run `just install-hooks` from the main checkout to point `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`. The committed pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) is intentionally light — it formats Rust code and checks Nix formatting, nothing else — so it doesn't block worktree workflows. Heavy gates (workspace clippy, full tests, supply-chain checks) run in CI.

### What still collides between worktrees

Even with per-worktree isolation, a few resources are shared and can cause concurrent commands to interfere:

- **`.git/objects/`, `.git/packed-refs`, and the shared hooks dir.** Each `git worktree add` directory has its own index, HEAD, and refs (in `.git/worktrees/<name>/`), but the object store, packed refs, and hooks dir are one set. The "git only runs from the main checkout" rule (see the top of this doc) is what keeps these from colliding — never bypass it. Even with that rule, the pre-commit hook still gets invoked on every commit, so keep it limited to formatting + fast checks; don't run a full `cargo test --workspace` from inside a hook.
- **The Lima VM's `/var/lib/mvm/`, `br-mvm` bridge, and TAP devices.** Vary microVM and TAP names between worktrees if you need two microVMs running at the same time.
- **The Nix store inside Lima.** This is shared by design (warm cache) and Nix's own locking handles it.

### Lima VM sharing

The Lima VM (`mvm-builder`) is shared across worktrees by design — **never fork it per worktree**. It is expensive to boot, and the Nix store inside it is the warm cache that makes builds fast; a per-worktree VM would duplicate tens of GB of store, re-download the kernel/rootfs, and multiply boot time with no isolation benefit. There is also no second VM name baked into the codebase: `mvmctl`, the `Justfile`, CI, and AGENTS.md examples all hard-code `mvm-builder`, and `RuntimeBuildEnv` / `run_on_vm` route through `mvm_runtime::config::VM_NAME`.

The `MVM_DATA_DIR` override is what isolates per-feature state — templates, sockets, the microVM registry, snapshots, signing keys. Anything that would otherwise land in `~/.mvm` ends up under the worktree.

State that *does* live inside the shared Lima VM (`/var/lib/mvm/`, the `br-mvm` bridge, TAP devices, in-flight microVMs) is the only collision surface between worktrees. If two worktrees need to run microVMs concurrently, give them distinct microVM and TAP names — do not spin up a second Lima VM.

### Optional: direnv

Users who already have direnv installed can opt in:

```bash
cp .envrc.example .envrc
direnv allow
```

This is a convenience for users who already have direnv installed; the `bin/dev` / `just dev-*` wrappers work without it.

### Cleaning up

After the feature merges:

```bash
git worktree remove ../.worktrees/mvm-<feature-slug>
```

### When NOT to use a worktree

Trivial single-line changes (typo fixes, doc word swaps, dependency bumps) can land directly on a topic branch in the main checkout. The worktree rule applies to anything that touches code, runtime state, or the registry.

## Definition of Done

No task is complete without tests. Every feature, bug fix, or refactor must include:

1. **Tests first**: Write or update tests covering the new/changed behavior before marking a task done. Unit tests for logic, integration tests for CLI and cross-crate interactions.
2. **All tests green**: Run `cargo test --workspace` and confirm zero failures. New tests must pass alongside all existing tests.
3. **Zero clippy warnings/errors**: Run `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` and fix all findings before calling a feature done. Never suppress a clippy lint with `#[allow(...)]` — fix the underlying issue instead.
4. **Compiling workspace**: Run `cargo check --workspace` (or full `cargo test`/`cargo build`) and fix any errors before you finish. Never leave the workspace in a non-compiling state.
5. **Update sprint spec**: After completing any phase, task, or sub-task, update `specs/SPRINT.md` to reflect the current status. Check off completed items (`- [x]`), update phase status labels (e.g. `**Status: COMPLETE**`), and add any new test counts or notes. The sprint spec must always accurately reflect what has been implemented.

## Test Expectations

- New types: serde roundtrip tests, default value tests where applicable.
- New protocol/wire code: roundtrip through mock I/O (e.g. `UnixStream::pair()`), error path tests (invalid input, wrong keys, malformed data).
- New CLI flags/commands: integration tests in `tests/cli.rs` verifying help text and argument parsing.
- Security code: positive path (valid data accepted), negative path (tampered/invalid data rejected), and edge cases (replay, wrong key, expired session).
- If a function can fail, test that it fails correctly (returns `Err`, not panic).

## Privacy & Security

Privacy and security are **critical priorities** for this project and must be considered in every decision. All code changes, architecture decisions, and feature additions must be evaluated through a security lens:

- **Never log, store, or expose sensitive data** (secrets, tokens, keys, credentials, user data) in plaintext — in code, logs, config files, or error messages.
- **Validate and sanitize all inputs** at system boundaries (CLI args, config files, network data, vsock messages).
- **Apply least privilege** — processes, microVMs, and agents should have only the minimum permissions they need.
- **Default to secure configurations** — encryption on, auth required, restrictive permissions. Users opt out of security, never opt in.
- **Guard secrets in transit and at rest** — use signing, encryption, and secure channels (vsock, not plaintext TCP) for sensitive communication.
- **No hardcoded secrets** — tokens, keys, and credentials must come from environment variables, secure config, or runtime injection. Never commit secrets to the repository.
- **Consider attack surface** in every feature — new network listeners, file permissions, IPC channels, and CLI commands are all potential vectors.
- **Security tests are mandatory** — every security-relevant code path must have tests for both the positive path (valid data accepted) and negative path (tampered, expired, unauthorized data rejected).

## Clippy: Zero Warnings, Always

**ALWAYS** run `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` after every code change and fix every finding before committing or declaring a task done. Clippy warnings are treated as errors — the CI pre-commit hook enforces this and will block commits.

Rules:

- **Never suppress a lint with `#[allow(...)]`** — fix the underlying issue instead. If you think a suppression is genuinely necessary, explain why in a comment and get explicit approval.
- **Fix warnings immediately** — do not accumulate clippy debt. A warning introduced now becomes harder to diagnose later.
- **Common findings to watch for**: `clippy::too_many_arguments` (refactor into a params struct), `clippy::redundant_closure`, `clippy::needless_pass_by_value`, `clippy::single_match` → `if let`, unused imports/variables.
- **After adding new code**, run clippy before moving on — don't wait until the end of a task.

## No `unwrap()` in Production Code

**NEVER** use `.unwrap()` in production code. Always use `.expect("descriptive message")` instead, so that if a panic occurs, the error message explains what went wrong and where. `.unwrap()` is only acceptable in test code (`#[cfg(test)]` modules and `tests/` directories).

## Documentation

Documentation is a **first-class deliverable**. Every code change that touches user-facing behavior MUST include corresponding doc updates in the same commit or PR. Stale docs are bugs.

### When to update docs

- **Adding a CLI command, subcommand, or flag** → update `reference/cli-commands.md` with the new entry
- **Changing command behavior or defaults** → update both `reference/cli-commands.md` and any affected guides
- **Adding/removing environment variables** → update the Environment Variables table in `reference/cli-commands.md`
- **Adding/changing config options** → update `guides/config-secrets.md`
- **Changing network layout or vsock behavior** → update `guides/networking.md`
- **Changing the manifest / build / registry workflow** → update `guides/manifests.md`
- **Changing Nix flake API (mkGuest)** → update `guides/nix-flakes.md`
- **Changing build/install steps** → update `getting-started/installation.md` and `contributing/development.md`

### Key doc files

- `public/src/content/docs/reference/cli-commands.md` — complete CLI command reference (every command, flag, and env var)
- `public/src/content/docs/reference/architecture.md` — workspace structure, dependency graph, key abstractions
- `public/src/content/docs/reference/filesystem.md` — drive model, rootfs layout, host-side paths
- `public/src/content/docs/reference/guest-agent.md` — guest agent, vsock protocol, probes
- `public/src/content/docs/guides/` — user guides (networking, templates, nix-flakes, config-secrets, troubleshooting)
- `public/src/content/docs/getting-started/` — quickstart, installation, first-microvm
- `public/src/content/docs/contributing/development.md` — contributor guide

### Rules

1. **Do not mark a task as done if docs are stale.** This is part of the Definition of Done.
2. **CLI reference must match the code.** If `commands.rs` has it, `cli-commands.md` must have it — same flags, same defaults, same descriptions.
3. **Verify after adding commands.** After adding or modifying any Clap command/subcommand/flag, diff `crates/mvm-cli/src/commands.rs` against `public/src/content/docs/reference/cli-commands.md` to confirm they match.
4. **Guides must reflect current behavior.** Don't document aspirational features — only what's implemented and working.

## Screenshots & Temporary Files

**NEVER** save screenshots, images, or any binary artifacts to the project root or any directory within the repository. Always save screenshots and temporary files to `/tmp/` (e.g. `/tmp/screenshot.png`, `/tmp/page-snapshot.png`). This prevents binary files from polluting the git history.

When using Playwright or other browser tools, explicitly set the output path to `/tmp/`:

- Screenshots: `filename: "/tmp/screenshot.png"`
- Snapshots: `filename: "/tmp/snapshot.md"`

If you accidentally save files to the repo, delete them immediately before committing.
