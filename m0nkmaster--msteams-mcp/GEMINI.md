# Agent Guidelines for Teams MCP

This document captures project knowledge to help AI agents work effectively with this codebase.

## Repository

- **Repository**: https://github.com/m0nkmaster/msteams-mcp
- **Install**: `npx -y msteams-mcp@latest` or clone the repo, `npm install && npm run build`, then point your MCP client to `dist/index.js`

## Project Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Microsoft Teams. Rather than using the complex Microsoft Graph API, it uses Teams APIs (Substrate, chatsvc, CSA) with authentication tokens extracted from a browser session. The browser is only used for initial login - all operations use direct API calls.

### Implementation Patterns

1. **Credential Encryption**: Session state and token cache are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with a machine-specific key derived from hostname and username. Files have restrictive permissions (0o600).

2. **Server Class Pattern**: `TeamsServer` class encapsulates all state (browser manager, initialisation flag), allowing multiple server instances and simpler testing.

3. **Error Taxonomy**: Errors use machine-readable codes (`ErrorCode` enum), `retryable` flags, and `suggestions` arrays to help LLMs understand failures and recover appropriately.

4. **Result Types**: API functions return `Result<T, McpError>` for type-safe error handling with explicit success/failure discrimination.

5. **HTTP Utilities**: Centralised HTTP client (`utils/http.ts`) provides automatic retry with exponential backoff, request timeouts, and rate limit tracking.

6. **Dynamic Configuration from Session**: All tenant-specific configuration is extracted from the user's session localStorage, ensuring compatibility across different Teams environments (commercial, GCC, GCC-High, DoD):

   - **Region & Partition**: Extracted from `DISCOVER-REGION-GTM` (e.g., region `amer`, partition `02`). The `getRegion()` and `getTeamsBaseUrl()` helpers in `auth-guards.ts` provide cached access.
   - **Teams Base URL**: Extracted from the `chatServiceAfd` URL in `DISCOVER-REGION-GTM` (e.g., `https://teams.microsoft.com` or `https://teams.microsoft.us` for government clouds). API endpoints use this dynamically.
   - **User Details**: Extracted from `DISCOVER-USER-DETAILS` including user MRI, license info (Copilot, transcription, etc.), and user/tenant partitions.
   - **Service URLs**: Full URLs for chatsvc, CSA, and mt/part APIs are available in the config and passed to API endpoint builders.

   **Note**: The Substrate search URL (`substrate.office.com`) is currently hardcoded as we haven't found a config source for it. If GCC users report issues, this may need to be configurable.

7. **MCP Resources**: Passive resources (`teams://me/profile`, `teams://me/favorites`, `teams://status`) provide context discovery without tool calls.

8. **Tool Registry Pattern**: Tools are organised into logical groups (`search-tools.ts`, `message-tools.ts`, etc.) with a central registry (`tools/registry.ts`). This enables:
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Easier testing of individual tools
   - Simpler addition of new tools

9. **Auth Guards**: Reusable authentication check utilities in `utils/auth-guards.ts` return `Result` types for consistent error handling across API modules. Also provides `getTenantId()` (cached) for deep link construction.

10. **Shared Constants**: Magic numbers are centralised in `constants.ts` for maintainability (page sizes, timeouts, thresholds).

11. **Markdown to Teams HTML**: Outgoing messages support markdown formatting via `markdownToTeamsHtml()` in `utils/parsers.ts`. This converts markdown (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, ` ```code blocks``` `, `~~strikethrough~~`, lists, newlines) to the HTML that Teams expects for `RichText/Html` messages. The converter is used by `sendMessage()` and `editMessage()` in `chatsvc-api.ts`. When messages contain @mentions or links, `parseContentWithMentionsAndLinks()` applies the same conversion to text segments between inline elements.

12. **Auto-Login on Auth Failure**: The `CallToolRequestSchema` handler in `server.ts` automatically retries tool calls that fail with `AUTH_REQUIRED` or `AUTH_EXPIRED` errors. Before returning the error to the LLM, it attempts headless re-authentication (token refresh → full headless login). If auto-login succeeds, the original tool call is retried transparently. If it fails, a strongly-worded error directs the LLM to call `teams_login` explicitly. Auth tools (`teams_login`, `teams_status`) are excluded from auto-retry to avoid loops. Concurrent auth failures are deduplicated via a Promise-based mutex — only one auto-login runs at a time, and parallel callers await the same result.

13. **Browserless Token Refresh**: Token refresh uses an HTTP-first strategy (`token-refresh-http.ts`). The MSAL refresh token is extracted from session state localStorage and exchanged for new access tokens via Azure AD's OAuth2 token endpoint — no browser needed (~1s vs ~8s). The `skypetoken_asm` cookie is obtained by exchanging the Skype Spaces access token via `authsvc.teams.microsoft.com/v1.0/authz`. Updated tokens are written back to session state in MSAL cache format so `token-extractor.ts` can find them. The `Origin: https://teams.microsoft.com` header is required because the Teams client ID is registered as a SPA (Azure AD error AADSTS9002327 without it). Falls back to headless browser refresh if HTTP fails (e.g., refresh token expired, Conditional Access). First login always requires a browser — no refresh token exists yet. Works identically for standard MS login and corporate SSO (ADFS/Okta federation).

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow

All operations use direct API calls to Teams APIs. A persistent browser profile (`~/.teams-mcp-server/browser-profile/`) stores Microsoft session cookies and MSAL tokens, enabling silent re-authentication without user interaction.

1. **First login**: Opens visible browser → user authenticates → session state saved → browser closed
2. **Token expiry**: Headless browser opens with persistent profile → Microsoft session cookies enable silent SSO → tokens refreshed → no user interaction needed
3. **Session fully expired**: Falls back to visible browser for manual re-login (with extensions like Bitwarden and saved form data available)
4. **All API operations**: Use cached tokens for direct API calls (no browser)

The **headless-first strategy** means `teams_login` always tries headless SSO before showing a visible browser. The persistent profile's long-lived Microsoft session cookies (lasting days/weeks) mean users rarely need to manually re-authenticate, even though MSAL tokens expire after ~1 hour.

The server uses the system's installed browser via Playwright's `launchPersistentContext()` (~180MB savings vs bundled Chromium):

- **Windows**: Uses Microsoft Edge (always pre-installed on Windows 10+)
- **macOS/Linux**: Uses Google Chrome

The persistent profile is shared between headless and visible modes. Only one process can use it at a time (Chromium profile lock). The token-refresh module uses a module-level flag to prevent concurrent access.

If the system browser isn't available, a helpful error message suggests installing Chrome or running `npx playwright install chromium` as a fallback.

### Token Management

- Tokens are extracted from browser localStorage after login
- The Substrate search token (`SubstrateSearch-Internal.ReadWrite` scope) is required for search
- Tokens typically expire after ~1 hour
- **Proactive token refresh** uses an HTTP-first strategy:
  1. **HTTP refresh (~1s)**: Extracts the MSAL refresh token from session state and POSTs to Azure AD's OAuth2 token endpoint for each required scope (Substrate, Skype Spaces, chatsvcagg). Then exchanges the Skype Spaces token for `skypetoken_asm` via `authsvc.teams.microsoft.com`. Updated tokens are written back to session state.
  2. **Browser fallback (~8s)**: If HTTP refresh fails (e.g., refresh token expired), opens a headless browser with the persistent profile. Microsoft's session cookies enable silent SSO.
- This is seamless to the user — no browser window shown, no interaction needed
- If both methods fail (e.g., Microsoft session fully expired), user must re-authenticate via `teams_login`

**Testing token refresh:** Use `npm run cli -- login` which will attempt headless SSO first, only showing a browser if user interaction is actually required.

### API Authentication

Different Teams APIs use different authentication mechanisms:

| API | Auth Method | Module | Helper Function |
|-----|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Search** (Substrate v2/query) | JWT Bearer token from MSAL | `auth/token-extractor` | `getValidSubstrateToken()` |
| **Email Search** (Substrate v2/query) | Same JWT as Search (contentSources: Exchange) | `auth/token-extractor` | `getValidSubstrateToken()` |
| **People/Suggestions** (Substrate v1/suggestions) | Same JWT + `cvid`/`logicalId` fields | `auth/token-extractor` | `getValidSubstrateToken()` |
| **Messaging** (chatsvc) | `skypetoken_asm` cookie | `auth/token-extractor` | `extractMessageAuth()` |
| **Favorites** (csa/conversationFolders) | CSA token from MSAL + `skypetoken_asm` | `auth/token-extractor` | `extractCsaToken()` + `extractMessageAuth()` |
| **Threads** (chatsvc) | `skypetoken_asm` cookie | `auth/token-extractor` | `extractMessageAuth()` |
| **Calendar** (mt/part/calendarView) | Skype Spaces token (`api.spaces.skype.com` scope) + `skypetoken_asm` | `auth/token-extractor` | `extractSkypeSpacesToken()` |
| **Transcripts** (Substrate WorkingSetFiles) | Same JWT as Search (Substrate scope) + `Prefer` header | `auth/token-extractor` | `getValidSubstrateToken()` |
| **Files** (Substrate AllFiles) | Same JWT as Search (Substrate scope) + message auth for user MRI | `auth/token-extractor` | `getValidSubstrateToken()` + `extractMessageAuth()` |
| **Profiles** (mt/part fetchShortProfile) | Skype Spaces token (`api.spaces.skype.com` scope) + `skypetoken_asm` | `auth/token-extractor` | `requireSkypeSpacesAuthWithConfig()` |

**Important**: The CSA API (for favorites) requires a GET request to retrieve data, POST only for modifications. The Substrate suggestions API requires `cvid` and `logicalId` correlation IDs in the request body.

**Region Discovery**: All regional APIs (chatsvc, csa, mt/part) use the region from the user's session via `getRegion()` in `auth-guards.ts`. This extracts the region from `DISCOVER-REGION-GTM` in localStorage (e.g., `amer`, `emea`, `apac`). For partitioned endpoints like mt/part (Calendar), the partition suffix (e.g., `02`) is also extracted from the same config.

### Session Persistence

Two layers of session persistence work together:

1. **Persistent browser profile** (`~/.teams-mcp-server/browser-profile/`): A dedicated Chrome/Edge profile that retains Microsoft session cookies, extensions (e.g. Bitwarden), and form autofill data across launches. This is what enables silent headless re-authentication.

2. **Encrypted session state** (`session-state.json`): Playwright's `storageState()` extracts cookies and localStorage from the browser context. Tokens are then extracted from this for direct API use without a browser.

Session state and token cache files are protected by:
1. **Encryption at rest**: AES-256-GCM encryption using a key derived from machine-specific values (hostname + username)
2. **File permissions**: Restrictive 0o600 permissions (owner read/write only)
3. **Automatic migration**: Existing plaintext files are automatically encrypted on first read

### Design Philosophy

The toolset follows a **minimal tool philosophy**: fewer, more powerful tools that AI can compose together. Rather than convenience wrappers for common patterns, the AI builds queries using search operators.

### Tool Documentation

**Source of truth**: Tool parameters, descriptions, and usage guidance are defined in the tool definitions themselves (`src/tools/*.ts`). These descriptions are sent to AI assistants via MCP and should be comprehensive.

When adding or modifying tools, ensure the `description` field in the tool definition includes:
- What the tool does
- Key parameters and their meaning
- Common pitfalls or gotchas
- Related tools to use together

For manual testing of all tools, see `docs/MANUAL-TEST-SCRIPT.md`.

## Roadmap Management

When a roadmap item is completed, **remove it entirely** from `ROADMAP.md`. Do not cross it out or mark it as done — just delete the row.

## Development

### Commands

```bash
npm run dev           # Run MCP server in development mode
npm run build         # Compile TypeScript
npm run lint          # Run ESLint (also lint:fix to auto-fix)
npm start             # Run compiled MCP server
```

### Testing

#### CLI (msteams)

`src/cli.ts` is a first-class, installable CLI (`msteams` bin) with **full tool parity** to the MCP server. It runs the same server in-process over an in-memory MCP transport, so every call goes through the real MCP protocol layer - which also makes it the test harness for that layer. Use `npm run cli` from a repo clone (runs via `tsx`, no build needed) or the installed `msteams` binary.

The CLI can call **any tool** generically. Unrecognised commands are treated as tool names (with `teams_` prefix added if missing). Use `--key value` for parameters.

```bash
# List available MCP tools and shortcuts
npm run cli

# Generic tool call (any tool works - auto-prefixes teams_ if missing)
npm run cli -- teams_find_channel --query "support"
npm run cli -- find_channel --query "support"

# Common shortcuts
npm run cli -- search "your query"              # teams_search
npm run cli -- status                           # teams_status
npm run cli -- login                            # teams_login (tries headless SSO first)
npm run cli -- login --force true               # Clear session and re-login
npm run cli -- send "Hello!" --to "conv-id"     # teams_send_message
npm run cli -- thread --to "conv-id"            # teams_get_thread
npm run cli -- activity                         # teams_get_activity

# Output raw MCP response as JSON
npm run cli -- search "your query" --json

# Pagination: get page 2 (results 25-49)
npm run cli -- search "your query" --from 25 --size 25
```

#### Unit Tests

The project uses Vitest for unit testing pure functions. Tests focus on outcomes, not implementations.

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests once
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
npm run typecheck     # TypeScript type checking only
```

**Test Structure:**
- **`src/utils/parsers.ts`**: Pure parsing functions extracted for testability
- **`src/utils/parsers.test.ts`**: Unit tests for all parsing functions
- **`src/__fixtures__/api-responses.ts`**: Mock API response data based on real API structures

**What's Tested:**
- HTML stripping and entity decoding (`stripHtml`)
- Teams deep link generation (`buildMessageLink`)
- Message timestamp extraction (`extractMessageTimestamp`)
- Person suggestion parsing (`parsePersonSuggestion`)
- Search result parsing (`parseV2Result`, `parseSearchResults`)
- JWT profile extraction (`parseJwtProfile`)
- Token expiry calculations (`calculateTokenStatus`)
- People results parsing (`parsePeopleResults`)
- Email result parsing (`parseEmailResult`, `parseEmailSearchResults`)
- Base64 GUID decoding (`decodeBase64Guid`)
- User ID extraction from various formats (`extractObjectId`)

#### Integration Testing

For testing against the live Teams APIs:
- Use `npm run cli -- search "query"` to test via the full MCP protocol layer

The CLI itself (`src/cli.ts`, run via `npm run cli` or the `msteams` bin) doubles as the MCP protocol test harness: it uses the SDK's `InMemoryTransport` to connect a client to the server in-process, so exercising a tool through the CLI verifies that tool definitions, input validation, and response formatting all work correctly through the protocol layer.

#### CI/CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push and PR:
- Linting (`npm run lint`)
- Type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
- Unit tests (`npm test`)
- Build (`npm run build`)
- Documentation review (on main commits, debounced to 2 hours) - checks README/AGENTS.md accuracy against code

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/doc-reviewer.yml` for workflow configurations.

### Extending the MCP

#### Adding New Tools

1. Choose the appropriate tool file in `src/tools/` (or create a new one for a new category)
2. Define the input schema with Zod
3. Define the tool definition (MCP Tool interface)
4. Implement the handler function returning `ToolResult`
5. Export the registered tool and add it to the module's `*Tools` array
6. Add the new array to `src/tools/registry.ts` if creating a new category
7. Use `Result<T, McpError>` return types in underlying API modules
8. Add shared constants to `src/constants.ts` if needed

#### Adding New API Endpoints

1. Add endpoint URL to `src/utils/api-config.ts`
2. Create a function in the appropriate `src/api/*.ts` module
3. Use `httpRequest()` from `src/utils/http.ts` for automatic retry and timeout handling
4. Return `Result<T, McpError>` for type-safe error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Session/Token Expired
If API calls fail with authentication errors:
1. Call `teams_login` with `forceNew: true`
2. Or delete the config directory (`~/.teams-mcp-server/` on macOS/Linux, `%APPDATA%\teams-mcp-server\` on Windows) and run `npm run cli -- login`

### Browser Won't Launch (for login)
- Ensure you have Chrome (macOS/Linux) or Edge (Windows) installed
- On Windows, Edge should be pre-installed; try updating Windows if missing
- On macOS/Linux, install Chrome from https://www.google.com/chrome/
- Alternatively, download Playwright's bundled browser: `npx playwright install chromium`
- Check for existing browser processes that may be blocking

### Login Timeout with MFA
MCP clients like Cursor have request timeouts (typically 2-5 minutes). If your organisation's SSO/MFA flow takes longer than this, the MCP request may timeout.

**What happens:** The AI receives a timeout error, but the login process continues in the background. Complete the MFA in the browser - the session will be saved and subsequent tool calls will work.

**Why this is rare:** The server attempts headless SSO first (no user interaction needed). A visible browser only opens when credentials are actually required. Most logins complete silently via SSO without hitting any timeout.

### Search Doesn't Find All Thread Replies
The Substrate search API is a **full-text search** which only returns messages matching the search terms. If someone replied to your message but their reply doesn't contain your search keywords, it won't appear in results.

**Example:** Searching for "Easter blockout" won't find a reply that says "Given World of Frozen opens the week before, I'd put a fair amount of money on 'yes'", even though it's a direct reply.

**Workaround:** After finding a message of interest, use `teams_get_thread` with the `conversationId` to retrieve the full thread context including all replies.

### Message Deep Links

Teams requires different deep link formats depending on conversation type:

| Conversation Type | Format | Notes |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| **Channel (top-level)** | `/l/message/{channelId}/{msgTimestamp}` | No extra params needed |
| **Channel (thread reply)** | `/l/message/{channelId}/{msgTimestamp}?parentMessageId={parentId}` | Parent ID from `ClientConversationId;messageid=xxx` |
| **1:1 / Group chat** | `/l/message/{chatId}/{msgTimestamp}?context={"contextType":"chat"}` | Context param required |
| **Meeting chat** | `/l/message/{meetingId}/{msgTimestamp}?context={"contextType":"chat"}` | Context param required |

**Conversation ID patterns:**
- Channels: `19:xxx@thread.tacv2`
- Meetings: `19:meeting_xxx@thread.v2`
- 1:1 chats: `19:guid_guid@unq.gbl.spaces`
- Group chats: `19:xxx@thread.v2` (non-meeting)

**Detecting thread replies:** Compare the `messageid` in `ClientConversationId` with the message's own timestamp from `DateTimeReceived`. If they differ, it's a thread reply and needs `parentMessageId`.

## Reference

### File Locations

Session files are stored in a user-specific config directory to ensure consistency regardless of how the server is invoked (npx, global install, local dev, etc.):

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.teams-mcp-server/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\teams-mcp-server\` (e.g., `C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\teams-mcp-server\`)

Contents:
- `session-state.json` (encrypted browser session)
- `token-cache.json` (encrypted OAuth tokens)
- `browser-profile/` (persistent Chrome/Edge profile with extensions and session cookies)

Legacy session files from the project root (`./session-state.json`) are automatically migrated to the new location on first read.

Development-only files (created in project root):
- **Debug output**: `./debug-output/` (gitignored, screenshots and HTML dumps)

Development files:
- **API reference**: `./docs/API-REFERENCE.md`
- **Session data reference**: `./docs/SESSION-DATA-REFERENCE.md`

### API Internals

**Conversation Types:** The chatsvc API returns `threadType` (`topic`, `space`, `meeting`, `chat`) and `productThreadType` (`TeamsStandardChannel`, `TeamsTeam`, `TeamsPrivateChannel`, `Meeting`, `Chat`, `OneOnOne`). See `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` for details.

**Virtual Conversations:** Special IDs like `48:saved`, `48:threads`, `48:mentions`, `48:notifications`, `48:notes` aggregate data across conversations. Messages include `clumpId` for the source conversation.

**User ID Formats:** The `extractObjectId()` function in `parsers.ts` handles all ID formats: raw GUIDs, MRIs (`8:orgid:...`), tenant-suffixed IDs, base64-encoded GUIDs (little-endian), and Skype IDs.

**1:1 Chat ID format:** `19:{userId1}_{userId2}@unq.gbl.spaces` (GUIDs sorted lexicographically).

**Deleted Messages:** The chatsvc messages API returns deleted messages with empty `content` and a `deletetime` property in `properties`. These are filtered out in `getThreadMessages()` to avoid confusing the AI with phantom "empty" messages that appear to be newer than actual content.

**Message Ordering:** The chatsvc messages API returns messages in **descending order (newest first)** by default. When `startTime` is provided, messages are returned in **ascending order** from that timestamp. The `getThreadMessages()` function defaults to newest-first (`order: 'desc'`) but accepts an `order` parameter to switch to oldest-first (`'asc'`) for chronological reading.

### API Endpoints

See `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` for full endpoint documentation with request/response examples.

Regional identifiers: `amer`, `emea`, `apac`

### Possible Tools

Based on API research, these tools could be implemented:

| Tool | API | Difficulty |
|------|-----|------------|
| `teams_get_person` | Delve person API | Easy |

**Known Limitations:**
- **Chat list** - Partially addressed by `teams_get_favorites` (pinned chats) and `teams_get_frequent_contacts` (common contacts), but no full chat list API
- **Presence/Status** - Real-time via WebSocket, not HTTP
- **Calendar** - Outlook APIs exist but need separate research

## Dependencies

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`: MCP protocol implementation
- `playwright`: Browser automation
- `zod`: Runtime input validation
- `vitest`: Unit testing framework (dev)
