Always use Yarn for dependencies.

This file outlines the coding rules and best practices for the MMO RPG server project. These guidelines ensure clarity, maintainability, scalability, and performance in the codebase. They are intended for both developers and AI/LLM assistance.

## General Coding Rules

1. **Use WebAssembly (WASM) for CPU-Intensive Tasks**
   - Offload heavy computations (e.g., procedural generation, physics) to C++ or Rust compiled to WASM.
   - Use Emscripten to compile and integrate WASM modules with Node.js via `WebAssembly.instantiate`.

2. **Leverage Worker Threads with SharedArrayBuffer**
   - Use Node.js worker threads for concurrent game logic (e.g., player updates, region events).
   - Share memory using `SharedArrayBuffer` for efficient data access across threads.

3. **Maintain Thread Safety**
   - Use `Atomics` to synchronize access to shared memory and prevent race conditions.

4. **Batch WASM Calls**
   - Minimize the frequency of WASM calls by batching computations (e.g., generating multiple map chunks at once).

5. **Avoid Blocking the Main Thread**
   - Keep the main Node.js thread free for I/O operations (e.g., WebSocket communication).
   - Offload CPU-intensive tasks to WASM or worker threads.

6. **Use Efficient Data Structures**
   - Store game state and map data in typed arrays (e.g., `Int32Array`, `Float32Array`) with `SharedArrayBuffer`.

7. **Implement Scalable Architecture**
   - Design for scalability, starting with worker threads and scaling out with multiple Node.js instances if needed.

8. **Monitor and Optimize Performance**
   - Regularly profile the server using tools like Node.js's `--prof` or external services.

9. **Ensure Compatibility and Stability**
   - Use well-tested versions of Node.js (e.g., LTS), WASM, and libraries. Avoid experimental features.

10. **Document and Comment Code**
    - Include clear comments and documentation, especially for WASM integration and worker thread logic.
    - Use JSDoc for functions and classes.

## Dependency Management

11. **Mandatory Yarn Usage**
    - Use Yarn exclusively for installing, updating, and managing dependencies (e.g., `yarn add`, `yarn install`).
    - Do not use npm or other package managers in this project.
    - Lock dependency versions in `yarn.lock` for consistent installations.

## TypeScript Adoption

12. **Use TypeScript Exclusively**
    - Write all new code in TypeScript with `.ts` file extensions.
    - Migrate existing `.js` files to `.ts` and add type annotations for parameters, return types, and variables.
    - Use TypeScript's type inference to reduce explicit annotations where possible (e.g., `const x = 5` instead of `const x: number = 5`).
    - Configure `tsconfig.json` with strict type checking enabled.

13. **Define Interfaces for Abstraction**
    - Use TypeScript interfaces to define contracts for classes and modules (e.g., `interface Player { id: string; position: number }`).
    - Implement interfaces to ensure type safety and modularity.
    - Prefer interfaces over type aliases for better extensibility.

14. **Type Safety Best Practices**
    - Use strict null checks and avoid `any` type.
    - Leverage union types and type guards for runtime type safety.
    - Use generics for reusable type-safe components.

## Lean and Small Code

15. **Minimize Code Size**
    - Avoid code duplication; refactor repeated logic into reusable functions or modules.
    - Use concise syntax (e.g., arrow functions `() => x`, optional chaining `?.`, destructuring `{ a, b }`).
    - Remove unused code, variables, or imports immediately.
    - Use short, meaningful variable names where context is clear.

16. **Optimize Algorithm Efficiency**
    - Use the smallest, most efficient algorithms and data structures for tasks (e.g., `Set` for unique items, typed arrays for numeric data).
    - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.
    - Use appropriate data structures for specific use cases (e.g., Map for key-value pairs).

## SOLID Principles

17. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - Ensure each class or module has one responsibility (e.g., `LobbyManager` only manages lobbies, not game logic).
    - Example: Split `server.ts` into separate I/O and logic handlers if it grows too complex.
    - Keep methods focused and small.

18. **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Design modules to be extensible without modification (e.g., use interfaces and polymorphism instead of altering base classes).
    - Example: Add new lobby types via subclasses rather than changing `LobbyManager`.
    - Use abstract classes and interfaces for extensibility.

19. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Ensure subclasses can replace their base classes without breaking functionality (e.g., a `VIPPlayer` class should work wherever `Player` is expected).
    - Maintain consistent behavior across inheritance hierarchies.
    - Avoid overriding methods in ways that violate the base class contract.

20. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - Define small, specific interfaces rather than large, general ones (e.g., separate `Movable` and `Damageable` interfaces for entities).
    - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
    - Split large interfaces into smaller, focused ones.

21. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations (e.g., inject a `Logger` interface into classes).
    - Example: Pass dependencies via constructor injection.
    - Use dependency injection containers for managing dependencies.

## LLM Token Optimization

22. **Minimize Token Count**
    - Use short, meaningful variable names (e.g., `pos` instead of `playerPosition`) where readability is not compromised.
    - Limit comments to essential explanations; avoid verbose documentation in code (e.g., use `// Init lobby` instead of a multi-line explanation).
    - Leverage TypeScript type inference to reduce explicit type annotations.
    - Remove redundant type annotations where TypeScript can infer types.

23. **Balance Readability and Conciseness**
    - Ensure token optimizations do not obscure code intent (e.g., avoid cryptic abbreviations like `x` for `position`).
    - Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase.
    - Keep function and class names descriptive but concise.

## Project Structure

24. **Folder Organization**
    - Follow the established folder structure for all new files.
    - Keep related files together in appropriate directories.
    - Use index files for clean exports.

25. **File Naming**
    - Use `.ts` extension for all TypeScript files.
    - Follow consistent naming patterns (e.g., `camelCase` for files, `PascalCase` for classes).
    - Use descriptive names that indicate file purpose.

## Testing and Quality

26. **Testing Requirements**
    - Write unit tests for all new functionality.
    - Maintain minimum 80% code coverage.
    - Use TypeScript for test files.
    - Mock external dependencies in tests.

27. **Code Quality**
    - Use ESLint with TypeScript support.
    - Format code with Prettier.
    - Run type checking before commits.
    - Review code for SOLID principles compliance.

## Version Control

28. **Git Practices**
    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
    - Follow GitFlow branching strategy.
    - Keep commits focused and atomic.
    - Review changes before merging.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Architecture Goals
- **Clarity**: Write code that is easy to read and understand.  
- **Maintainability**: Structure the code for easy updates and debugging.  
- **Modularity**: Break functionality into reusable, independent components.  
- **Scalability**: Design systems to handle increased load efficiently.

### Technologies
- Use WebAssembly (WASM) for procedural generation and CPU-heavy tasks.  
- Use worker threads with `SharedArrayBuffer` for concurrent processing.
- Use TypeScript for all JavaScript code.

### Folder Structure
Organize the project as follows:

project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── lobby/
│   │   │   ├── lobbyManager.ts
│   │   │   └── lobbyWorker.ts
│   │   └── game/
│   │       ├── player.ts
│   │       └── world.ts
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── logger.ts
│   │   └── helpers.ts
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── env.ts
│   │   └── constants.ts
│   ├── wasm/
│   │   ├── procedural_generator.cpp
│   │   ├── lobby_generator.wasm
│   │   └── proceduralGenerator.ts
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── server.ts
│   └── index.ts
├── tests/

├── scripts/
│   └── build_wasm.sh
├── docs/
│   └── architecture.md
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── .env

### Code Conventions
1. **Naming Conventions**  
   - Files/Folders: `camelCase` (e.g., `lobbyManager.ts`)  
   - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `LobbyManager`)  
   - Functions/Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `createLobby`)  
   - Constants: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`)

2. **Modularization**  
   - Each file should have a single responsibility (e.g., one class or function group per file).  
   - Use ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) for dependency management.

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Wrap asynchronous operations in `try-catch` blocks.  
   - Log errors centrally using `utils/logger.ts`.

4. **Comments and Documentation**  
   - Use JSDoc for all public functions and classes (e.g., `@param`, `@returns`).  
   - Add a file-level comment describing its purpose.

5. **Asynchronous Code**  
   - Prefer `async/await` over callbacks or raw promises for readability.

6. **Testing**  
   - Write unit tests for each module using Jest, located in `tests/`.  
   - Aim for at least 80% code coverage.

7. **Linting and Formatting**  
   - Use ESLint with Airbnb style guide for linting.  
   - Use Prettier for consistent formatting.

8. **Version Control**  
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., "feat: add lobby creation logic").  
   - Follow a branching strategy like GitFlow (e.g., `main`, `develop`, feature branches).
