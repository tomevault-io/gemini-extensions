# Copilot Instructions — The Cheat Code

## What This Is

"The Cheat Code" is an internal Microsoft newsletter distributed weekly to the ABS Tech Strategy team (AI Business Solutions). Each issue features a reusable agentic pattern for Copilot Chat, extracted from real customer engagements. The name is a play on "chat" (Copilot Chat) and "cheat" (cheat codes) — the Konami code motif appears subtly in every issue.

## Architecture

Each issue exists in **four parallel formats**, all produced from the same source content:

1. **HTML email** (`issues/the_cheat_code_issue_NNN.html`) — primary format, 600px max-width, inline CSS, Outlook-compatible
2. **PDF** (`issues/the_cheat_code_issue_NNN.pdf`) — rendered from HTML via Chrome headless, attached to Engage posts
3. **Viva Amplify content** (`viva_amplify/issue_NNN_amplify.md`) — section-by-section content mapped to Amplify web parts
4. **Architecture diagram** (`diagrams/issue_NNN_*_rich.png`) — rendered from companion HTML/CSS files in `diagrams/`
5. **Interactive portal** (`docs/`) — GitHub Pages site with Bento grid portal and step-through diagram walkthroughs. Separate design system from the email newsletter.

The **PRODUCTION_PLAYBOOK.md** is the authoritative reference for all production processes. Read it first when working on anything.

## Hosting & Distribution

- **GitHub Pages archive:** https://aka.ms/the-cheat-code (resolves to `microsoft.github.io/ai-cheatcode`)
- **Repo:** `microsoft/the-cheat-code` (private, GitHub Enterprise)
- **Pages source:** `main` branch, `docs/` folder
- **Workflow:** Edit files → `git push` → GitHub Pages auto-deploys
- The portal (`docs/index.html`) shows all published issues in a Bento grid layout. Interactive walkthroughs live at `docs/interactive/issue-NNN/`.
- Only the `docs/` folder is reader-facing via Pages. Everything else (playbook, series plan, templates) lives in the repo but isn't linked from the portal.
- The `docs/index.html` should only show **published** issues + a "Coming Next" teaser for the next one. Update it as each issue is sent.

## Alternating Cadence: Conceptual → Practical

Starting with Issue #007, the series follows a two-issue arc model:

- **Odd issues (🧠 Conceptual Pattern)**: Names the pattern, explains *why* it exists, frames the architecture, identifies design decisions. Sections: Intro → Pattern Breakdown → Where This Pattern Lands → Quick Tips. No Agent Spotlight.
- **Even issues (🔧 Practical Build)**: Shows *how* to build it in Copilot Studio, step-by-step with components. Sections: Intro (links back to conceptual pair) → Agent Spotlight (the build) → Pattern Breakdown (components in build order) → Try This Now.

The issue info bar carries a type tag: `🧠 CONCEPTUAL PATTERN` or `🔧 PRACTICAL BUILD`.

Issues #001–006 predate this cadence and stand as-is — no rebranding.

## Content Model

Each issue follows a fixed structure defined in `the_cheat_code_template.html`:

- **Header**: Dark navy (#1B1B3A), unique Konami code glyphs per issue (see Symbol Registry in playbook)
- **Intro**: Customer problem → pattern name (2 paragraphs max)
- **Agent Spotlight** (when featuring a specific agent): Attribution, scenario, solution
- **Pattern Breakdown** (always): The core reusable pattern with numbered design decisions
- **Rotating sections**: Quick Tips, Try This Now, Where This Pattern Lands (not all appear in every issue)

### Key Editorial Rules

- Lead with the customer scenario, never write a demo recap
- One agent demo often yields 2–4 standalone patterns — disaggregate them into separate issues
- Every section must answer: "How does this make me faster as a CSA?"
- Full name attribution for the builder in every issue
- Cross-reference related issues when patterns connect — all cross-refs are hyperlinked to the Pages archive

## Series Plan

Detailed arc briefs with full content outlines are in `series_plan/`:
- `SERIES_ROADMAP.md` — master roadmap, editorial calendar, Konami code assignments
- `arc_1_adaptive_guardrails.md` through `arc_6_custom_connectors.md` — per-arc content briefs

## Diagram Production

Diagrams use **HTML/CSS rendered via Chrome headless** (not Mermaid, not Paper Banana).

### Render commands

```bash
CHROME="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"

# Render diagram PNG (1680px wide, height varies per diagram)
"$CHROME" --headless --disable-gpu --no-sandbox \
  --screenshot="diagrams/issue_NNN_name_rich.png" \
  --window-size=1680,HEIGHT \
  "file://$PWD/diagrams/issue_NNN_name.html"

# Render newsletter PDF
"$CHROME" --headless --disable-gpu --no-sandbox \
  --print-to-pdf="issues/the_cheat_code_issue_NNN.pdf" \
  --print-to-pdf-no-header "file://$PWD/issues/the_cheat_code_issue_NNN.html"
```

**Critical**: Chrome `--screenshot` silently clips content taller than `--window-size` height. Always match the `min-height` in body CSS to the `--window-size` height. When in doubt, add 100–200px.

### Diagram Design System

- **Zone containers**: 16px border-radius, 2px solid colored border, linear gradient background, drop shadow
- **Component cards**: White `#FFFFFF`, 12px rounded corners, inside zones
- **Icon badges**: 30px rounded squares with emoji
- **Color palette**: Purple `#6B2FA0` (agents), Blue `#0078D4` (Azure), Green `#107C10` (output/trust), Orange `#D83B01` (external/warnings), Amber `#CA5010` (decisions/gates)

Copy an existing diagram HTML file from `diagrams/` as your starting point for new diagrams.

## Interactive Portal Design System

The interactive portal at `docs/` uses a separate design system from the email newsletter.

### Typography (Google Fonts)
- **Outfit** — body text, descriptions, UI elements
- **Sora** — display text, headings, card titles
- **JetBrains Mono** — code snippets, badges, labels, monospace elements

### Color System
- All newsletter colors carry over (Purple #6B2FA0, Blue #0078D4, Green #107C10, Orange #D83B01)
- **Dark theme**: Navy deep #0E0E1F (background), Navy #1B1B3A (surfaces), Navy light #252548 (cards)
- **Glassmorphism**: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` with semi-transparent borders
- **Pattern type gradients**: Warm (orange-tinted) for Practical issues, cool (blue-tinted) for Conceptual issues

### Portal Layout (Bento Grid)
- 12-column CSS Grid with mixed card sizes
- Hero cards (latest arc) span 6 cols, medium cards span 4-5, small cards span 3
- Utility cards: Subscribe, Sample Code, About, Stats, Brand
- Scroll-reveal animations via IntersectionObserver
- Responsive breakpoints: 1100px (8-col), 720px (2-col), 480px (1-col)

### Interactive Diagram Pages
- Shared framework: `docs/interactive/shared/interactive.css` + `interactive.js`
- Each page: Bento font imports + shared CSS/JS + issue-specific inline styles
- **StepEngine** drives step-through walkthroughs with narrative panels
- **Context panels** show implementation details when clicking components:
  - `contextMode: 'lightweight'` — what it is, requirements (pills), prerequisites (checklist), links, code snippets
  - Data provided via `data-context` JSON attribute on diagram elements
- Clean directory URLs throughout (no `.html` extensions)
- Konami code easter egg on every page

### Creating a New Interactive Page
1. Copy an existing issue page from `docs/interactive/issue-001/`
2. Add Google Fonts import (Outfit, Sora, JetBrains Mono)
3. Add Bento font overrides for diagram-specific CSS classes
4. Add `contextMode: 'lightweight'` to `window.interactiveConfig`
5. Add `data-context` JSON attributes to diagram elements
6. Update page header with issue badge and "← Back to patterns" link
7. Update portal `docs/index.html` with new card in the Bento grid

## Newsletter Styling

- Max width: 600px, font: Segoe UI family, body 15px `#444444` on white
- Top accent bar: 6px `#6B2FA0`
- Color-coded 4px left borders per section: Purple (Spotlight), Blue (Pattern), Green (Tips), Orange (Try This), Amber (Positioning)
- Callout boxes: Warning (`#FFF8E1`/`#FFE082`), Insight (`#F0ECF5`), Flow diagram (`#F0F6FF`), Positioning (`#FFF3E0`/`#FFCC80`)
- All CSS must be inline for email compatibility; use `<!--[if mso]>` conditionals for Outlook
- Footer includes: "ABS Tech Strategy • AI Business Solutions" and "Browse all issues at aka.ms/the-cheat-code"

## Publishing Workflow

1. Finalize the issue HTML in `issues/`
2. Render PDF via Chrome headless
3. Create/render the diagram in `diagrams/`
4. Create/update the interactive page in `docs/interactive/issue-NNN/`
5. Move the issue from "Coming Next" to "Published" in `index.html`
6. Add or update the issue card in `docs/index.html` (Bento portal)
7. Update the "Coming Next" teaser to the following issue
8. `git add -A && git commit && git push` — Pages auto-deploys
9. Send the HTML email (Monday AM)
10. Post the Viva Engage teaser from `viva_engage_posts.txt` (Monday PM)

## Pre-Send Checklist

Before publishing any issue, verify: no placeholder text remaining, correct issue number and date, unique Konami glyphs (check Symbol Registry in playbook), full builder attribution, accurate cross-references with working hyperlinks, type badge (🧠/🔧) in info bar, "ABS Tech Strategy" in footer, `aka.ms/the-cheat-code` archive link, and reasonable file size (18–28KB typical for HTML).

## Decision Log (Key Decisions)

- **"ABS Tech Strategy"** not "AIWF Team" — represents the broader org
- **No rebranding of #001–006** — published, in inboxes, cadence starts at #007
- **Copilot Studio as default practical stack** — widest CSA audience, immediately actionable
- **aka.ms/the-cheat-code** — vanity URL pointing to GitHub Pages archive
- **Private repo, public-facing Pages** — repo holds all working files, only index + issues are reader-facing
- **Alternating cadence** — inspired by Issue #007 producing two equally strong versions (conceptual + practical)
- **Bento design for portal, Segoe UI for email** — portal uses Outfit/Sora/JetBrains Mono dark theme; email newsletter keeps Segoe UI for Outlook compatibility. Two design systems, one brand.
- **Lightweight context mode as default** — interactive pages use `contextMode: 'lightweight'` showing requirements, prerequisites, links, and code snippets. No detailed specs tables needed.
