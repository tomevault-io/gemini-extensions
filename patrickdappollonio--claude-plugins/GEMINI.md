# CLAUDE.md — patrickdappollonio/claude-plugins

A Claude Code **plugin marketplace**. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` lists the
plugins under `plugins/`.

## Hard rules

- **Never add Claude/AI attribution** to commits or PRs — no `Co-Authored-By:
  Claude`, no "Generated with Claude Code". This is a standing, non-negotiable
  constraint from the repo owner.
- **Commit/push only when asked.** Work on a branch, not `main`.
- **Bump the plugin's version on every meaningful change**, in its
  `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, following
  [semver](https://semver.org/): **patch** for fixes and doc/wording tweaks,
  **minor** for new backwards-compatible capability (a new command, fence, or
  skill behavior), **major** for breaking changes (removed/renamed commands,
  changed file formats or defaults users rely on). Pure repo chores that don't
  touch a plugin (root README, CI) don't need a bump. The version lives **only** in that
  `plugin.json` — there are no git tags, GitHub releases, or per-plugin
  versions in `marketplace.json` to check or update, so don't go looking.
- **Both install paths must stay equivalent: Claude Code marketplace *and*
  `npx skills`.** A Claude Code install brings a whole plugin (every skill under
  `plugins/<name>/skills/`); `npx skills add … --skill <name>` installs **one
  skill directory and nothing above it**. So a skill must be **self-contained**:
  everything it needs lives inside its own `skills/<skill>/` directory, and
  nothing in `SKILL.md` may reach outside it — no `../` paths, no "see the other
  skill's file", no reliance on a sibling skill being present, and no symlinks
  (a symlink out of the directory arrives as a plain text file on a Windows
  checkout with `core.symlinks=false` — a silent, broken install). Duplicating
  shared prose or code into each skill is the correct trade-off, as visual-docs
  does with the renderer. A plugin may hold several skills; each must work alone.
  When you add a skill, also add it to the root README's `--skill` name table,
  and phrase cross-skill references so they degrade to a name a reader can
  install ("the full `adversarial-review` skill"), never a relative path.
- **Skills: extract whatever can be read on demand, but always keep the
  general guideline inline — otherwise the extraction is moot.** The whole
  `SKILL.md` loads into context on every invocation, so keep it under ~500
  lines. It holds what steers behavior on *every* pass — principles, the
  process outline, decision tables, rationalizations, red flags, the checklist
  — plus a short, self-sufficient summary of every extracted topic (the rule,
  the threshold, the one-line procedure). The comprehensive version — full
  procedures, routing tables, handoff templates, digests of other skills — goes
  in a `.md` file **in the same skill directory**, and the summary says exactly
  when to read it ("read `cyclomatic-complexity.md` before splitting a
  function"). An agent that never opens the side file must still do the right
  thing from the summary alone. Load-bearing discipline rules stay inline in
  full — an agent under pressure will skip a side file. Reference sibling
  files by bare filename, never a path, so both install paths ship them.
  And the skill must **insist that the agent read every companion file on
  first use in a session, before any other step** — a dedicated section near
  the top listing the files, plus a red flag and a checklist item — and re-read
  the named file at its step. Summaries are reminders of text already read,
  never a substitute. `code-simplification` is the worked example.
- The visual-docs server has **no authentication**. `--host` / `0.0.0.0` binding
  must stay opt-in and documented as trusted-network-only.
- **Agents must never have to write code — not even a small script — to operate
  visual-docs.** Every operation an agent performs (resolve a directory, serve,
  read comments, set status, lint, stop) must be a first-class `node
  visual-docs-server.js --<command>` / `visual-docs-lint.js` invocation that
  prints **ready-to-read, formatted text** (never JSON the agent must parse, and
  never something it has to `curl`/`jq`/`python`/`node -e` to consume). Keep these
  commands **OS-agnostic as much as possible**: do the platform-specific work
  (temp dirs via `os.tmpdir()`, backgrounding via detached `spawn`, HTTP via
  `fetch`) *inside* the Node CLI, so the skill only ever runs `node <script>
  <args>` — no `nohup`/`&`, no `/tmp` paths, no shell-only constructs. When you
  add an agent-facing capability, add a `--command` for it; don't make the agent
  improvise glue.

## visual-docs architecture

A zero-dependency reader you serve locally. Nothing is remote.

**Where the code lives — read this before editing anything under
`plugins/visual-docs/`.** The canonical renderer is `extras/visual-docs/`
(`server/` + `shared/`), which sits outside every plugin so it is never itself
installed and never has to be chosen between. Each skill that needs it carries a
**real, committed copy** at `plugins/visual-docs/skills/<skill>/{server,shared}`.
That duplication is deliberate: `npx skills` installs a skill directory and
nothing above it, and a symlink out of that directory arrives as a plain text
file on a Windows checkout (`core.symlinks=false`) — a silent, broken install.

- **Always edit `extras/visual-docs/`, never a copy**, then run
  `node scripts/sync-visual-docs.mjs --write`. Verify with
  `node scripts/sync-visual-docs.mjs` (no flag) — CI runs it and fails on drift.
- The copies are marked `linguist-generated` in `.gitattributes`; they still must
  be committed.

- **Server** (`server/`): plain `node:http`, no framework. `bin/…-server.js`
  self-manages via a lock file (`.visual-docs/server.json`) — supports
  `--restart`, `--stop`, bare `--host`. `lib/server.js` holds routing, SSE live
  reload, the single access gate (`resolveServable`: safeJoin + hidden-segment
  check + realpath + ext allowlist), image magic-byte sniffing, and the comments
  API. Only markdown + content-sniffed images are served.
- **Viewer** (`server/assets/`): **Preact 10 + htm, vendored, no build step**
  (`app.js` is loaded directly). Globals: `window.preact`, `window.preactHooks`,
  `window.htm`. The document body is a "Preact-owns-the-element-but-we-manage-it-
  imperatively" escape hatch — the `<article id="content">` is empty in the vdom
  and hydrated via `innerHTML` + hydrate passes in effects.
- **Vendored deps** (`server/assets/vendor/`) are pinned with **Subresource
  Integrity** and an SBOM. Regenerate with `node server/scripts/update-vendor.mjs`;
  verify with `--verify` (CI runs this — deps must be committed).

### Fences & components (all rendered client-side, then DOMPurify-sanitized)

`tldr`/`summary` (prominent top-of-doc summary card; markdown body),
`mermaid`, `nomnoml`, `diff`/`patch`, `migration` (up/down + unified/side-by-side
toggle), `api`/`http`, `openapi`/`swagger`, `filetree`/`files` (tree-table with
A/M/D/R + notes), `question`/`ask` (interactive; answers post as comments),
GitHub admonitions (`> [!NOTE]` …). Authoring reference:
`extras/visual-docs/shared/authoring-guide.md`; quality bar:
`extras/visual-docs/shared/document-quality.md`.

**When you add a new fence/component, also:** register it in the gutter
`COMPONENTS` list (if commentable), document it in `authoring-guide.md` + the
README fence table, and **add a rule for it to the linter**
(`extras/visual-docs/server/bin/visual-docs-lint.js`) — at minimum recognize its language(s) and
validate its shape, so `visual-docs-lint` covers every component.

### Comments

Stored in `<served-dir>/.visual-docs/comments.json`. **Agents use the `node` CLI
— never JSON:** `visual-docs-server.js --comments <dir>` prints the digest,
`--status <dir> <id[,…]> <state>` sets lifecycle state (plain-text confirmation).
Those wrap the HTTP API, which exists for the browser client / direct use: `GET
/agent/comments.md` (same markdown digest), `POST /api/comments/status`
(`{id|ids, status}`), `GET /api/comments` (raw JSON, browser only). Lifecycle
`status`: **new → acknowledged → resolved** (legacy `resolved:true` still
honored); hand-editing the JSON still works but the CLI/endpoint is supported.
Each status change appends `{status, at}` to the comment's `history` array
(server-side, capped at 20) — the viewer renders it as lifecycle microcopy
("agent is working on this · 2m ago"); older files without `history` still work.
Rule of thumb: **don't serve JSON to the agent — format it** (markdown digest,
`--docdir`/`--serve`/`--status` all print ready-to-read text).
Anchors: text (quote+prefix/suffix), component (type+stable-id+hint), or section
(heading). A best-effort `line` is resolved (client + server) by normalizing the
rendered quote and raw markdown to bare alphanumerics before matching, so
`path:line` survives bold/`code`/[links]/smart-quotes/soft-wraps.
The **gutter comment button** (Notion-style) is the single add-a-comment
affordance — it follows the hovered block into the right margin for every block
type (headings, paragraphs, lists, code, components).

## Gotchas (things that have bitten us)

- **DOMPurify's mXSS guard strips an attribute value that looks like it closes a
  comment/tag** (matches `/((--!?|])>)|<\/(style|title)/i` — e.g. mermaid's
  `-->`). Fence sources are therefore **base64-encoded** into `data-*` attrs
  (`blockAttrs`/`encodeSrc`). Don't put raw source in a data attribute.
- DOMPurify keeps inline `<svg>`, `<form>`/`<input>`, and `style` — verified.
  Icons are inline SVG (`ICON` map), never emoji (emoji render inconsistently).
- **`[hidden]` must win**: several affordances are `display:inline-flex` but
  toggled via the `hidden` attribute, so `[hidden]{display:none!important}` is in
  the reset. Don't remove it.
- **Scope top-level table CSS as `.markdown-body > table`** — a bare
  `.markdown-body table` clobbers diff2html's nested tables.
- Effects that render into `#content` guard stale async work with a `cancelled`
  flag; the SSE handlers re-check `currentRef` before `setDoc`.

## Running & testing

```bash
# serve a directory of markdown docs
node extras/visual-docs/server/bin/visual-docs-server.js <dir>
node extras/visual-docs/server/scripts/update-vendor.mjs --verify   # deps intact?
```

Headless verification uses `playwright-core` + a system Chromium (see prior test
scripts): load a doc, `waitUntil:'load'` (never `networkidle` — SSE keeps the
connection open), then assert rendered SVGs/blocks and screenshot. Always test
with external requests blocked to prove it works fully offline.
