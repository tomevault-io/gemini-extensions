# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Madina Collar is a fabric sales/ordering system with **four interfaces in this repo**, each in its own top-level folder:

1. **Mobile app** (`mobile/`) — Expo-managed React Native app. The original/primary client.
2. **Web app** (`web/`) — Next.js 14 (Pages Router) app that **deliberately re-implements the same ordering flow** (auth → catalog → product/size-selection → checkout → orders) as the mobile app, hitting the same backend API. Treat it as a parallel client, not a shared codebase — it duplicates logic rather than importing from `mobile/src/` (different framework, different storage APIs).
3. **Admin panel** (`mc-admin-panel/`) — React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4 SPA for staff/admins (`role: 'admin' | 'superadmin'`): dashboard analytics, order management, fabric quality/style/attribute/price-matrix CRUD, customer list, staff management. Hits the same backend's `/api/admin/*` and `/api/auth/*` routes. Independently maintained from `mobile/`/`web/` — its own React/Vite tooling, its own re-implementation of admin-facing screens.
4. **Backend** (`backend/`) — Express + Sequelize (PostgreSQL) API shared by all three frontends.

Each of `mobile/`, `web/`, `mc-admin-panel/`, and `backend/` has its own `package.json`/`node_modules` and is developed independently — there is no shared root-level `package.json` or workspace tooling tying them together.

Because the mobile and web apps are independently-maintained copies of the same flow, **a business-logic or bug fix (e.g. price lookup, cart key format, order payload shape) usually needs to be applied twice** — once in `mobile/src/` (JS) and once in `web/src` (TS) — unless it's purely a backend fix. `mc-admin-panel/` is a separate flow (admin/staff-facing, not the customer ordering flow) and does not duplicate mobile/web logic, but it does share the backend's `/api/admin/*` contract — a backend admin-route change (path, payload shape, response shape) must be checked against `mc-admin-panel/src/pages/*.jsx` too.

## Production Deployment

The app is **live in production**:
- **Web** (customer app): https://almadina.site
- **Admin panel**: https://admin.almadina.site
- **Backend API**: https://api.almadina.site

Infrastructure:
- Backend runs on a **DigitalOcean droplet** at `168.144.74.52` (Bangalore region).
- **PostgreSQL** runs locally on the droplet (user: `madina`, database: `madina_collar`).
- **PM2** manages both Node processes: `madina-backend` (port 5000) and `madina-web` (port 3000).
- **Nginx** routes traffic by host: `almadina.site` → Next.js (web app, port 3000), `api.almadina.site` → Express (backend, port 5000), `admin.almadina.site` → the admin panel's static `dist/` build.
- **SSL** via Let's Encrypt, auto-renewing.
- Secrets live **only on the server** (not committed to git): `web/.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.almadina.site/api`; `backend/.env` has `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY`.

All in-repo hardcoded backend URLs now point at `https://api.almadina.site` (previously the LAN IP `http://192.168.18.18:5000` in mobile/backend/web, and `http://localhost:5000` in `mc-admin-panel/`). The three hardcoded IP references this file used to warn about are fixed — `backend/routes/admin.js` (upload URL) and `web/src/utils/api.ts` now use the production host. **`mobile/src/utils/api.js` auto-detects the dev host from the Expo/Metro connection for local development, but still needs the production URL (`https://api.almadina.site/api`) set before building the mobile app for the Play Store.**

## Development Commands

### Mobile app (`mobile/`)
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
npm run lint

Backend (backend/)

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

Requires a backend/.env (see Environment Variables below) and a reachable
PostgreSQL instance. There is no test script and no seed/migration tooling —
schema is created/altered at boot via sequelize.sync({ alter: true }).

Web app (web/)

cd web
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint

Optional NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL env var overrides the default backend URL (now
https://api.almadina.site/api). In production, web/.env.local sets this to
https://api.almadina.site/api (server-only, not committed).

Admin panel (mc-admin-panel/)

cd mc-admin-panel
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
npm run lint

No env vars — the backend base URL is hardcoded to https://api.almadina.site
throughout (see Cross-Cutting Gotchas). No proxy config in vite.config.js;
relies on the backend's open CORS (origin: '*'). The panel is served in
production from admin.almadina.site (static dist/ build) and talks to
https://api.almadina.site. (Previously this was hardcoded to
http://localhost:5000, so for local dev against a local backend you'd
temporarily point these at your local server.)

Architecture

Backend (backend/)

  - ES modules, single entry point backend/server.js: wires Express, CORS
    (currently origin: '*', wide open), JSON body parsing, /uploads static file
    serving, Sequelize model associations, and the three routers.
  - Routers, mounted flat with no controller layer — logic lives directly in
    backend/routes/*.js:
      - auth.js → /api/auth — registration (3-step OTP flow), login, logout, and
        also admin account bootstrap (POST /api/auth/admin/register, POST
        /api/auth/admin/forgot-password), both gated by ADMIN_SECRET_KEY rather
        than a JWT. This is easy to miss since it lives in the auth router, not
        admin.js.
      - order.js → /api/orders — place order, list own orders.
      - admin.js → /api/admin — dashboard stats/analytics, order management,
        full quality/style/attribute/price-matrix CRUD (GET /api/admin/qualities
        is the one unauthenticated admin route — both frontends call it directly
        to render the public catalog), staff and user management (GET/PUT/DELETE
        /users/:id, role: 'user' only). Deleting a customer via DELETE
        /users/:id doesn't cascade-delete their orders — the Orders.userId FK is
        ON DELETE SET NULL, so their past orders survive as "orphaned" (no
        attached customer); the admin panel's Orders.jsx already renders that
        case as Guest, so this is safe, just worth knowing before assuming a
        delete removed all trace of a customer.
  - backend/middleware/auth.js verifies the JWT and rejects blacklisted tokens
    (BlacklistedToken table, populated on logout — there's no scheduled cleanup,
    so it grows unbounded).
  - backend/middleware/adminAuth.js only checks role === 'admin' ||
    'superadmin'. Several routes in admin.js additionally call a local
    isMaster(req) helper that checks the exact same condition — redundant but
    harmless.
  - All User-returning admin responses (login, POST /staff, PUT /users/:id)
    explicitly allowlist fields rather than returning the raw Sequelize instance
    — POST /staff used to res.json(staff) the whole row, which leaked the bcrypt
    password hash over the wire; it's now field-limited like the rest. If you
    add a new endpoint that creates/updates a User, allowlist the response
    fields rather than returning the model instance directly — there's no
    serializer/toJSON override on the User model doing this for you.
  - Data model (Sequelize, see backend/models/): Quality → hasMany Style →
    hasMany ProductAttribute and → hasMany PriceMatrix; User → hasMany Order →
    hasMany OrderItem. ProductAttribute.type is an enum
    (category|color|width|size) — a single table drives all four selectable
    option groups per style. PriceMatrix rows key on (styleId, categoryId,
    colorId, widthId, sizeId) with widthId nullable (some styles have no width
    dimension).
  - Image uploads (multer, backend/uploads/) are served back with a hardcoded
    production URL (https://api.almadina.site/uploads/...) baked into the
    response in admin.js — this must match wherever the backend actually runs
    (previously a LAN IP). Mobile and web's image-URL builders rewrite whatever
    host is embedded to match their configured API host, so they render
    correctly regardless; mc-admin-panel/ doesn't rewrite it, but since both the
    panel and the baked-in URL now use api.almadina.site, uploaded-image
    previews render correctly in production.
  - No request validation library — most routes trust the request body shape
    (req.body) as-is.
  - Outbound OTP verification messages are processed asynchronously in the
    backend using the service helper backend/utils/whatsapp.js which dynamically
    targets official Meta WhatsApp Cloud API or third-party providers (like
    UltraMsg) based on active environment configurations.

Mobile app (mobile/, Expo)

  - mobile/App.js/mobile/index.js bootstrap → AppNavigator.js (React Navigation
    stack). It swaps the entire navigator stack based on
    useAuthStore.isAuthenticated: unauthenticated → Splash, Auth; authenticated
    → Quality, SizeSelection, ConfirmOrder. There's no shared shell/tab bar
    between the two states.
  - State: Zustand stores in mobile/src/store/, no persistence middleware —
    useAuthStore manually reads/writes Expo SecureStore (userToken, userData)
    inside setAuth/checkAuth/logout; useCartStore is in-memory only (cart is
    lost on app restart).
  - Cart model: cart is { [configKey]: { [sizeValue]: qty } } where configKey =
    "${qualityName}|${styleName}|${categoryValue}|${colorValue}[|${widthValue}]"
    — width segment is only appended when the style has widths.
    ConfirmOrderScreen.js re-parses this key by splitting on | and re-matching
    against the fetched catalog to resolve price, so the key's field order and
    separator are load-bearing — do not change casually without checking web
    too.
  - mobile/src/utils/api.js auto-detects the backend host from the Expo/Metro
    connection for local development (no more hardcoded LAN IP), with a
    FALLBACK_HOST constant for non-Expo-Go builds. There's no env var
    indirection on mobile (unlike the web app's NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL), so before
    building for the Play Store this must be pointed at the production URL
    https://api.almadina.site/api. It also exposes getImageUrl(), which rewrites
    the backend's baked-in upload host to the resolved API host.
  - mobile/src/components, mobile/src/hooks, mobile/src/constants/theme.ts are
    leftover Expo-router starter-template scaffolding (themed-text/view,
    parallax scroll, use-color-scheme) and are not used by the actual screens in
    mobile/src/screens/ — the real app is built with React Navigation + inline
    StyleSheet, not Expo Router / file-based routing despite expo-router being a
    dependency and app.json enabling typedRoutes.

Web app (web/, Next.js Pages Router)

  - Pages under web/src/pages/: index (marketing/landing, redirects to /catalog
    if authenticated), auth (mirrors the mobile 3-step registration + login
    UI/logic), catalog, product (style/category/color/width/size picker —
    equivalent to mobile's SizeSelectionScreen), checkout (equivalent to
    ConfirmOrderScreen), orders.
  - State: same Zustand pattern as mobile but adapted to the browser —
    authStore.ts reads/writes window.localStorage directly (not cookies, not
    SSR-safe by design — every store method guards on typeof window !==
    "undefined"); cartStore.ts additionally uses zustand/persist against
    localStorage under key madina-collar-cart, so unlike the mobile app, the web
    cart survives a page reload.
  - web/src/utils/api.ts adds a response interceptor that force-logs-out and
    redirects to /auth on any 401, plus a getImageUrl() helper that rewrites
    whatever host is embedded in a stored image_url to match the configured
    API_URL's host — needed because the backend bakes in its own LAN IP (see
    above) which may differ from the web app's configured API host.
  - Route guarding is a hook, useRequireAuth()
    (web/src/hooks/useRequireAuth.ts), called at the top of every protected
    page; it calls checkAuth() then client-side-redirects to /auth if
    unauthenticated. There is no middleware-based route protection (Next.js
    middleware.ts is not used).
  - The exact same cart-key convention and price-matrix lookup logic
    (category+color+optional width+size → price) as mobile is reimplemented
    independently in product.tsx/checkout.tsx (see getMatrixPrice/cartItemsList
    in checkout.tsx) — when changing pricing or attribute logic, check both.
  - web/.next/ is a build artifact directory and should not be edited or treated
    as source.

Admin panel (mc-admin-panel/, React 19 + Vite + Tailwind v4)

  - Routing via react-router-dom v7 in src/App.jsx: public /login, /register,
    /forgot-password; everything else (/dashboard, /orders, /qualities,
    /qualities/:id, /customers, /staff) is wrapped in a local ProtectedRoute
    that just checks a truthy token in the Zustand store (no expiry/validity
    check) and renders inside AdminLayout (sidebar shell + <Outlet/>). Unknown
    paths redirect to /dashboard, which itself bounces unauthenticated users to
    /login.
  - State: single Zustand store src/store/useAdminStore.js holding admin, token,
    theme, persisted manually to three separate localStorage keys (adminUser,
    adminToken, theme) — no zustand/persist middleware, no cookies. logout()
    calls POST /api/auth/logout to blacklist the token, then clears
    storage/state regardless of the call's outcome.
  - No shared axios instance/interceptor — every page imports axios directly and
    hardcodes https://api.almadina.site per call-site (dozens of occurrences
    across src/store/useAdminStore.js and every file in src/pages/; previously
    http://localhost:5000). 401 handling is inconsistent: only
    QualityDetails.jsx explicitly logs out + redirects on a 401; other pages
    don't. (main.jsx also sets an axios default baseURL from VITE_API_URL, but
    the absolute per-call-site URLs override it.)
  - Auth pages (AdminLogin.jsx, AdminRegister.jsx, AdminForgotPassword.jsx)
    map 1:1 onto the admin-bootstrap routes already documented under
    backend/routes/auth.js (POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/admin/register,
    POST /api/auth/admin/forgot-password, all ADMIN_SECRET_KEY-gated on the
    backend except plain login). AdminLogin.jsx additionally does a
    client-side-only role check (rejects non-admin/superadmin roles after the
    token is already returned by the server) — this is a UI gate, not a security
    boundary.
  - Authorization is unified and role-based across the panel: AdminLayout,
    Staff.jsx, and QualityDetails.jsx all gate "master"-level UI (Staff nav
    item, Staff page access, full quality/pricing edit powers) on admin?.role
    === 'admin' || admin?.role === 'superadmin' — which matches the backend's
    own isMaster(req) check in admin.js. There used to be a second, inconsistent
    gate (admin?.email === 'master@madina.com') on
    AdminLayout/Staff.jsx/Dashboard.jsx that made the UI hide "master" features
    from every admin except one hardcoded email, even though the backend has
    always granted every role: admin account full access — that's been removed
    so the UI now honestly reflects what any admin can already do via the API.
    This is still UI-only convenience gating, not a security boundary — the
    backend's isMaster/adminAuth middleware is the real enforcement point, and
    it's the same role-based check everywhere.
  - Main pages and the backend routes they drive: Dashboard.jsx (GET
    /dashboard-stats, GET /analytics, Recharts visualizations), Orders.jsx (GET
    /orders, PUT /orders/:id/status, plus react-to-print-driven invoice printing
    via InvoicePrint.jsx), Qualities.jsx (list/create/update/delete fabric
    qualities, multipart image upload), QualityDetails.jsx (style/attribute CRUD
    and price-matrix editing — POST /pricing/update destroys+recreates
    PriceMatrix rows rather than upserting; POST /pricing/seed-dummy zero-fills
    missing combinations), Customers.jsx (list/edit/delete customers via
    GET/PUT/DELETE /users/:id), Staff.jsx (list/create/delete role: 'admin'
    accounts).
  - Dashboard no longer has a "Nuke System" button — it called a DELETE
    /api/admin/system/nuke endpoint that never existed on the backend
    (dead/broken feature) and has been removed rather than implemented, since a
    real full-system-wipe endpoint is a high-blast-radius feature that shouldn't
    exist without a deliberate spec (backups, confirmation flow, audit log). If
    a "reset demo data" feature is wanted later, scope and name it deliberately
    rather than reviving this.
  - InvoicePrint.jsx is a pure presentational forwardRef component (props only,
    no API calls) rendering an A4 invoice with hardcoded shop
    letterhead/address/return-policy text and a synthesized invoice number
    (SL_${10000 + order.id}), not a real invoice-numbering system.

Environment Variables

backend/.env (present on the server and locally; note plain .env is not
gitignored in this repo — only .env*.local is — so be careful not to commit it).
In production on the droplet it holds:

  - DATABASE_URL — full PostgreSQL connection string (the local droplet
    Postgres: user madina, db madina_collar). config/db.js prefers DATABASE_URL;
    the individual DB_NAME/DB_USER/DB_PASS/DB_HOST vars are the fallback path
    when it's not set.
  - JWT_SECRET — JWT signing secret.
  - ADMIN_SECRET_KEY — required by /api/auth/admin/register and
    /api/auth/admin/forgot-password.
  - PORT — backend port (default 5000).
  - WHATSAPP_PROVIDER — targets chosen vendor (e.g. meta or ultramsg).
  - ULTRAMSG_INSTANCE_ID — third party instance token id.
  - ULTRAMSG_TOKEN — third party connection secret key.
  - META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID — official Meta business profile identifier.
  - META_ACCESS_TOKEN — official Meta platform system authorization string.
  - META_TEMPLATE_NAME — pre-approved official Meta utility pattern reference.

web/.env.local (server-only, not committed):
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.almadina.site/api — overrides the default
backend base URL. The in-code default is also https://api.almadina.site/api.

Mobile app has no .env support — mobile/src/utils/api.js auto-detects the dev
host from the Expo/Metro connection (with a FALLBACK_HOST constant), so it needs
the production URL hardcoded before a Play Store build.

mc-admin-panel/ has no .env support wired into its call-sites — its API base URL
(https://api.almadina.site, previously http://localhost:5000) is hardcoded per
call-site across every page and the store (see Architecture above). main.jsx
reads VITE_API_URL for the axios default baseURL, but the absolute per-call-site
URLs override it. If you add real configurability, route every call through a
shared axios instance instead of editing each hardcoded literal.

Cross-Cutting Gotchas

  - Backend host is now the production domain https://api.almadina.site across
    the repo (previously three different hardcoded hosts): the backend's
    upload-URL construction (backend/routes/admin.js) and web
    (web/src/utils/api.ts, overridable via NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) use it;
    mc-admin-panel/ hardcodes it per call-site (previously
    http://localhost:5000); mobile/src/utils/api.js auto-detects the host in dev
    (previously the LAN IP http://192.168.18.18:5000). Changing where the
    backend runs still requires touching multiple places — backend's admin.js
    upload URL, web's fallback (or its env var), every hardcoded call site in
    mc-admin-panel/, and the mobile fallback/production URL — since there's no
    single shared config.
  - The public catalog endpoint (GET /api/admin/qualities) is unauthenticated by
    design even though it lives under /api/admin — both consumer frontends
    (mobile/web) rely on this to render the catalog before/without a role check;
    mc-admin-panel/s Qualities.jsx also calls it without an auth header for its
    list view, while QualityDetails.jsx calls the same endpoint with an auth
    header purely to get 401 handling on token expiry (there's no GET
    /qualities/:id, so it re-fetches the full list and filters client-side by
    id).
  - OTP codes expire after 60 seconds server-side (Otp.expires_at) with no
    resend endpoint — both frontends just reset a local countdown timer and let
    the user re-submit step 1. Not applicable to mc-admin-panel/, which has no
    OTP flow (admin registration is a single adminSecret-gated form).
  - There are no automated tests in any of the four subprojects. This repo has
    been manually end-to-end tested at least once (auth flows for all three
    frontends' backend contracts, full admin CRUD, order placement → admin view
    → status update → customer re-fetch, image upload) via direct API calls
    against a real local Postgres instance — see git history around the
    fix/admin-panel-bugs branch for what was verified and what was found broken
    at that point in time. Re-verify manually before trusting this note
    long-term; it decays as the code changes.
