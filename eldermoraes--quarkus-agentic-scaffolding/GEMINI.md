# Quarkus + LangChain4j + AI Stack - Project Conventions
# Version: 0.19.1

These conventions apply whenever Codex or Bob writes, reviews, or configures code in a Quarkus +
LangChain4j project. They are always-on. Procedural scaffolding steps and starter code live in
the `scaffold-project` skill and its templates, not here.

---

## 1. Required tooling (mandatory)

These tools are prerequisites for this project, not suggestions. Do not work around their absence:
if a required tool is unavailable, stop and report it rather than falling back to model memory or a
generic web search.

- **Quarkus Agents MCP - required for every Quarkus task.** Project creation, extension selection,
  configuration, version checks, API usage, and troubleshooting MUST go through the Quarkus Agents
  MCP; never create a Quarkus project, add an extension, or answer a Quarkus question from model
  memory by hand. Before any Quarkus task, VERIFY the MCP is reachable - its `quarkus_*` tools are
  present and a cheap call (e.g. `quarkus_status`) succeeds. If the tools are absent or the call
  fails, STOP immediately: report exactly what is missing, point the user to
  `/setup-agentic-scaffolding` (and to restarting the session after registering it, since MCPs load
  at session start), and end the turn. A missing or unreachable MCP is never permission to proceed
  manually - do not fall back to the Quarkus CLI, Maven/Gradle archetypes, model memory, or web
  search, do not offer to "continue without it", and do not treat the stop as optional. The only
  exception is `/setup-agentic-scaffolding`, whose job is to install it.
- **context7 - required for external library and framework documentation.** Before relying on
  memory or web search for any library or framework API - LangChain4j included - you MUST look it
  up with `context7` first.
- **superpowers skills - use whenever applicable.** Invoke the relevant `superpowers` skill
  capabilities for the task at hand.

---

## 2. Java conventions

- **Java 25 is the minimum language level**, not a ceiling. Compile with
  `maven.compiler.release` set to at least 25 and adopt newer language levels freely. Document
  any project that must pin an older level and explain why (see section 6). One cap applies to
  native targets: GraalVM ships no releases for JDK 26, 27, or 28, so native-image stays on the
  JDK 25 baseline (with quarterly updates) until JDK 29 lands (September 2027) - projects that
  build a native binary keep `maven.compiler.release` at 25 until then
  ([GraalVM release-train announcement](https://medium.com/graalvm/accelerating-the-graalvm-release-train-26b0d7cff2ab)).
- **Default to Virtual Threads for I/O-bound and blocking concurrent work.** Platform threads
  are acceptable only when the runtime or a critical dependency forbids virtual threads (for
  example, a JDBC driver that pins the carrier). When a blocking AI or tool call must run inside
  a reactive endpoint, run it on a virtual thread rather than on the event loop.
- **Use Scoped Values in place of `ThreadLocal`** for request- or agent-scoped identity that
  must survive virtual-thread continuations, avoiding the leakage and inheritance pitfalls of
  `ThreadLocal`.
- **Structured concurrency for related subtasks.** For fan-out across related concurrent
  subtasks, prefer declarative parallelism (LangChain4j `@ParallelAgent` / `@ParallelMapperAgent`,
  see section 4) or explicit virtual-thread fan-out (`Thread.startVirtualThread(...)` or an
  `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()`), instead of ad-hoc executor coordination.
  `StructuredTaskScope` is the preferred structured-concurrency primitive where the project can
  enable it; note it is a Java preview feature (requires `--enable-preview`) with GraalVM
  native-image considerations, so adopt it only when the preview flag and the native target
  allow.
- **Prefer records, sealed types, and pattern matching where they clarify intent.** Use records
  for DTOs and value objects (they also minimize the GraalVM reflection surface), sealed
  interfaces for closed hierarchies such as event or result types, and pattern-matching `switch`
  over those hierarchies so the compiler enforces exhaustiveness.

---

## 3. Quarkus conventions

- **Import the platform BOMs; do not pin extension versions.** Import `quarkus-bom` and
  `quarkus-langchain4j-bom` at the same platform version and let the BOMs manage every extension
  and LangChain4j version.
- **CDI-first.** Use `quarkus-arc` and standard CDI (`@ApplicationScoped`, `@Inject`,
  `@Produces`) for wiring. Produce framework objects (retrieval augmentors, memory providers,
  embedding stores) from `@ApplicationScoped` producer beans.
- **REST and API surface.** Use `quarkus-rest` (Quarkus REST) with `quarkus-rest-jackson` for JSON
  (Jackson is the Quarkus default serializer), and expose `quarkus-smallrye-openapi` so endpoints
  are documented and explorable.
- **Errors leave the REST edge as RFC 9457 problem details.** Add `quarkus-http-problem`
  (`io.quarkiverse.httpproblem`) and every exception escaping a resource becomes an
  `application/problem+json` response instead of a raw 500 with a stack trace - which matters
  here because an unhandled model timeout, a dead inference endpoint, or a throwing tool would
  otherwise leak prompts and internal names to the caller; the server still logs the failure in
  full. It needs no configuration: the `quarkus.http-problem.*` keys only tune it, and
  `include-details` stays `false` so parser failures do not echo internal class names. This
  covers the REST edge only - the WebSockets Next streaming path keeps its own `@OnError`
  handling (section 4) - and it complements rather than replaces the declarative fault tolerance
  in section 4, which handles failure *inside* the service. The extension is in the platform BOM
  from Quarkus 3.38.0, so it takes no version pin.
- **Streaming uses WebSockets Next.** For token or progress streaming, use
  `quarkus-websockets-next` rather than rolling a custom transport (see section 4 for the
  streaming pattern).
- **Observability comes from platform extensions, not code.** Add
  `quarkus-micrometer-registry-prometheus` (metrics, scraped at `/q/metrics`) and
  `quarkus-opentelemetry` (traces) and AI services are instrumented automatically: per-method
  timers and counters (`langchain4j.aiservices.*`), GenAI-semconv token usage
  (`gen_ai.client.token.usage`, tagged by operation and token type), one span per AI-service
  call (`langchain4j.aiservices.<Interface>.<method>`) and per tool call
  (`langchain4j.tools.<tool>`). Register a CDI `CostEstimator` bean
  (`io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.cost`) to emit `gen_ai.client.estimated_cost`. Prompt and
  completion text reaches spans only when explicitly enabled
  (`quarkus.langchain4j.tracing.include-prompt` / `.include-completion`) - treat those as
  dev-only, since they record user content.
- **Enable parameter-name retention.** Configure the compiler with `-parameters` (Maven:
  `<parameters>true</parameters>`), which REST and AI-service binding rely on.
- **Build for both JVM and native.** Keep a `native` Maven profile so the project can produce a
  GraalVM native binary alongside the JVM build, and gate native integration tests in that
  profile. Native builds compile against the GraalVM JDK 25 line until JDK 29 (September 2027) -
  see section 2 - so a project with a native profile does not raise the language level above 25.
- **Disable Dev Services when an external model endpoint is configured.** When the project points
  at a real Ollama endpoint (local or cloud), disable LangChain4j Dev Services
  (`quarkus.langchain4j.devservices.enabled=false`) so a container is not started implicitly.

---

## 4. LangChain4j conventions

- **Declarative AI services are the default.** Define AI services as CDI-managed interfaces
  annotated with `@RegisterAiService` (the Quarkus form of LangChain4j's declarative service),
  using `@SystemMessage` / `@UserMessage` for prompts and `@MemoryId` for per-conversation
  memory. Prefer this over manual `ChatModel` wiring unless there is a documented reason.
- **Tools are CDI beans.** Expose actions to a model with `@Tool` methods on `@ApplicationScoped`
  beans, wired via `@RegisterAiService(tools = ...)` or `@ToolBox` - never hand-rolled JSON
  function dispatch. Tool methods doing I/O follow the section 2 virtual-thread rules.
- **Multi-agent workflows are composed declaratively.** Build agentic workflows from
  `@RegisterAiService` agents annotated with `@Agent(name, description, outputKey)` and orchestrate
  them with the LangChain4j Agentic annotations - `@SequenceAgent`, `@ParallelAgent`,
  `@ParallelMapperAgent`, and `@SupervisorAgent` (+ `@SupervisorRequest`) - assembling results
  with `@Output` over the `AgenticScope`. Use the `quarkus-langchain4j-agentic` extension. Avoid
  hand-rolled executor or coordination glue between AI services.
- **Structured output via typed return values.** Have services return records or enums to get
  structured results, and set `temperature=0` for classification and other deterministic tasks.
- **Name and right-size models.** Configure models by name (`@RegisterAiService(modelName = "...")`
  on services, `@ModelName("...")` on injected models) and use a small, fast, low-temperature model
  for cheap subtasks (classification, query rewriting) and a larger model for the primary task.
- **Streaming pattern: reactive only at the edge.** Stream over `quarkus-websockets-next`
  (`@WebSocket`, `@OnTextMessage` returning a Mutiny `Multi`, `@OnError`). Keep the agent and
  engine logic free of reactive types: have the WebSocket delegate to an `@ApplicationScoped`
  orchestrator that runs the blocking pipeline on a virtual thread
  (`Multi.createFrom().emitter(...)` + `Thread.startVirtualThread(...)`) and emits progress.
  Mutiny appears only at the channel edge, never inside the engine.
- **Guardrails wrap AI services declaratively.** Validate prompts/responses with
  `@InputGuardrails` / `@OutputGuardrails` beans implementing the upstream
  `dev.langchain4j.guardrail` interfaces (the Quarkus-specific guardrail API was retired in favor
  of upstream); tune retries with `quarkus.langchain4j.guardrails.max-retries`.
- **Fault tolerance is declarative on AI-service methods.** With
  `quarkus-smallrye-fault-tolerance`, put MicroProfile `@Timeout`, `@Retry`, and `@Fallback`
  (`org.eclipse.microprofile.faulttolerance`) directly on `@RegisterAiService` methods, with the
  fallback as a `default` method on the same interface - never hand-rolled try/retry loops
  around AI calls. Size `@Timeout` generously on tool-calling methods: a single invocation may
  span several model/tool round-trips before it returns.
- **Reusable instructions ship as skills, not as prompt strings.** When behavior would otherwise
  be pasted into an ever-growing `@SystemMessage`, put it in a `SKILL.md` (YAML front matter with
  `name` and `description`, instructions in the body), point
  `quarkus.langchain4j.skills.directories` at the folder, and annotate the service or method with
  `@Skills` (`io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.skills`, extension `quarkus-langchain4j-skills`). The
  extension registers an `activate_skill` tool and a system message advertising what is
  available, so the model pulls in a skill's instructions only when they apply - the prompt stays
  small and each skill stays independently editable. Narrow the surface with `@Skills("name")`
  rather than exposing everything. The extension is `status:preview`: pin the behavior you depend
  on with a test, and expect its API to move.
- **RAG starts simple with Easy RAG.** For retrieval-augmented generation, start with the
  `quarkus-langchain4j-easy-rag` extension plus an in-process embedding model: point
  `quarkus.langchain4j.easy-rag.path` at a documents folder and let it ingest on startup. Move to
  a hand-built `RetrievalAugmentor` (a CDI-produced `EmbeddingStore` + `EmbeddingStoreContentRetriever`)
  only when a project needs control Easy RAG does not provide.
- **Enable request/response logging.** Set `quarkus.langchain4j.log-requests=true` and
  `quarkus.langchain4j.log-responses=true` so prompts and model output are observable during
  development.

---

## 5. Testing

No test suite is mandated, so treat this as the intended baseline rather than an observed standard.
Apply it when adding tests:

- Use `@QuarkusTest` (artifact `io.quarkus:quarkus-junit`) for integration-style tests and
  `io.rest-assured:rest-assured` to exercise HTTP endpoints.
- Run native integration tests through `maven-failsafe-plugin` inside the `native` profile.
- Keep model interactions deterministic in tests (`temperature=0`, fixed prompts) or mock the
  model so tests do not depend on live inference.
- Grade model *quality* with the evaluation framework
  (`quarkus-langchain4j-testing-evaluation-junit5` + semantic-similarity / AI-judge strategies)
  rather than brittle string asserts; keep the scaffolded `@QuarkusTest` wiring smoke test green
  without a live model.

---

## 6. Scope and overrides

These conventions apply to projects in this Quarkus + LangChain4j stack. A per-project addition
or override is allowed when justified - for example, pinning a fixed older Java version, choosing
platform threads for a pinning dependency, or selecting a different model provider - and must be
documented inline near the override so the deviation and its reason stay visible.
