# Zaxy: Event-Sourced Temporal Knowledge Graph Fabric

## Problem Statement

Markdown files + vector DBs are the dominant approach for agent persistent context, but they are fundamentally lossy and inefficient:

- **No relational reasoning**: Vector similarity can't do multi-hop traversal or follow causal chains.
- **No temporal awareness**: Can't answer "What was true then vs. now?" — facts overwrite each other silently.
- **Non-replayable**: Context is chunked and flattened; you can't reconstruct how the agent arrived at a decision.
- **Un-auditable**: No provenance chain for compliance or debugging.

> **Current architecture (read this first).** The controlling architecture docs
> are [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [README.md](README.md).
> The default projection backend is the **embedded LadybugDB** store (in-process,
> no external service); Neo4j, pgGraph, and LatticeDB are optional backends
> selected via `PROJECTION_BACKEND`, behind one pluggable projection contract.
> Some ADRs below predate the embedded-default move and are kept as historical
> decision records — where an older note says "Neo4j", read "the projection
> backend (embedded by default)".

## Architecture Decision Record

### ADR-1: Event-Sourced Foundation

**Decision**: Use Eventloom's append-only JSONL as the immutable source of truth.

**Rationale**:
- Hash-chain integrity (tamper-evident).
- Deterministic replay.
- Zero write overhead (local file append).
- Cross-process locking already solved.

**Trade-off**: Single-writer per file. For multi-agent distributed setups, shard by session or add a log aggregation layer later.

### ADR-2: Hybrid Extraction (Rule-Based + LLM Fallback)

**Decision**: Extract entities/relations from events using registered rule-based extractors first, LLM fallback only for unstructured events.

**Rationale**:
- Eventloom events are strongly typed (`goal.created`, `task.proposed`, etc.).
- Typed events map deterministically to graph schema.
- Reduces LLM extraction cost by 60–80%.
- Faster ingestion (<50ms vs 500ms–2s for LLM).

**Trade-off**: New event types require writing an extractor. This is intentional — it forces schema discipline.

### ADR-3: Direct Neo4j Cypher vs. Graphiti Abstraction

**Decision**: Use the official `neo4j` Python driver with custom Cypher rather than Graphiti's high-level `add_episode` API.

**Rationale**:
- Full control over bi-temporal schema (`valid_from`, `valid_to`).
- Our extraction engine already produces structured `ExtractedEntity`/`ExtractedEdge` objects.
- Graphiti's LLM-based extraction is redundant with our hybrid extractor.
- Graphiti's hybrid search (vector + BM25 + traversal) can be replicated with native Neo4j indexes.

**Trade-off**: We maintain more Cypher. Mitigated by keeping queries simple and tested.

**Update**: the projection layer is now a pluggable contract. Embedded LadybugDB
is the default backend; Neo4j-direct-Cypher is one optional backend among several
(pgGraph, LatticeDB).

### ADR-4: Hybrid Retrieval (Exact + Keyword + Traversal)

**Decision**: Query router fuses three strategies with configurable weights.

**Rationale**:
- **Exact**: Fast lookup when the query is an entity name.
- **Keyword/BM25**: Full-text for semantic similarity on names/summaries.
- **Traversal**: Multi-hop expansion from top keyword hits.
- Each covers blind spots of the others.

**Trade-off**: Fusion adds ~10–50ms latency. Acceptable for agent context quality.

### ADR-5: Pathlight for Observability (Not Storage)

**Decision**: Pathlight can trace every memory operation when enabled, but does not store context itself.

**Rationale**:
- Eventloom = durable history.
- Projection backend (embedded LadybugDB by default) = structured reasoning layer.
- Pathlight = execution tracing + breakpoints + diff.
- Clean separation of concerns.

**Trade-off**: Extra network call per traced operation. Mitigated by async batching and optional disabling.

### ADR-6: MCP as Primary Interface

**Decision**: Expose memory via MCP tools (`memory_append`, `memory_query`, `memory_replay`, `memory_invalidate`).

**Rationale**:
- Framework-agnostic (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude Desktop, etc.).
- Standardized schema discovery and type safety.
- One-click integration via `mcpServers` config.

**Trade-off**: Requires MCP client support. Major frameworks already have it (2025+).

## Development Workflow

1. **Write the test first** (Karpathy rule). Every public function must have a test before the implementation is considered complete.
2. **Unit tests mock external deps** (projection backends, Pathlight, filesystem).
3. **Integration tests use Docker** (marked `@pytest.mark.integration`).
4. **Coverage gate: ≥90%** (enforced by CI).
5. **Lint/format with ruff**, type-check with mypy.

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Scope | External Deps | Marker |
|-----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Unit | Single function/class | Mocked | `unit` (default) |
| Integration | Cross-module + real DB | optional backend (e.g. Neo4j) Docker | `integration` |
| E2E | Full agent run | Full Docker stack | `e2e` (future) |

Run unit tests: `pytest`
Run integration tests: `pytest -m integration`
Run with coverage: `pytest --cov` (default in pyproject.toml)

## Integration Points

### Eventloom (Bottom Layer)
- **Input**: Zaxy reads `.eventloom/*.jsonl` files.
- **Output**: Zaxy appends projection metadata back to Eventloom (optional).
- **Contract**: `Event` Pydantic model matches Eventloom JSONL schema.

### Projection backend (Core Memory)
- **Default**: embedded LadybugDB (in-process; no external service).
- **Optional**: Neo4j (`bolt://localhost:7687`, auth `neo4j/testpassword` local dev), pgGraph, LatticeDB — selected via `PROJECTION_BACKEND`.
- **Schema**: `Entity(name, entity_type, valid_from, valid_to, ...)` + `RELATES(relation_type, valid_from, valid_to)`
- **Indexes**: Vector index (embedding), Fulltext index (BM25)

### Pathlight (Top Layer)
- **Collector**: `http://localhost:4100`
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3100`
- **Traced Operations**: `append`, `query`, `replay`, `invalidate`
- **Eventloom Panel**: Pathlight renders Eventloom exports natively.

### MCP (Interface Layer)
- **Transport**: stdio (default) or SSE
- **Tools**:
  - `memory_append(event_type, actor, payload, thread?)`
  - `memory_query(query, temporal_filter?, limit?)`
  - `memory_replay(session_id, from_seq?)`
  - `memory_invalidate(entity_name, entity_type, invalid_at)`

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Event append | <50ms | Local JSONL write + lock |
| Rule-based extraction | <10ms | Pure Python dict mapping |
| Projection upsert | <100ms | MERGE + index lookup |
| Hybrid query | <200ms | Parallel exact + keyword + traversal |
| Total context retrieval | <300ms | End-to-end |
| Token reduction vs. chunk RAG | 70–90% (target; unvalidated) | Structured paths vs. raw text. Validate with `scripts/chunk_rag_token_compare.py` — quality-controlled (token reduction at *equal answer-bearing recall*, pinned chunk-RAG baseline) — driven by a gold-labeled QA dataset through the gated benchmark. |

## Next Steps

1. Build the zero-friction embedded graph runtime path further by
   running the same-harness backend shootout at meaningful scale, reporting
   projection throughput, checkout latency, traversal latency, returned tokens,
   injected tokens, LongMemEval Answer@5/Recall@5, citation coverage, dashboard
   graph load time, memory footprint, and rebuild recovery for embedded,
   LatticeDB, Neo4j, pgGraph, and BM25.
2. Build the Memory Activation Layer so `zaxy init` and a launcher path such as
   `zaxy activate codex` make checkout/context injection the default session
   behavior, while CLI and dashboard surfaces expose last checkout, last
   capture, stale checkout, no-memory-use warnings, and token-efficiency
   diagnostics.
3. Keep Neo4j as the release default and quality control backend until the
   embedded graph path preserves temporal semantics, citations, inferred-edge
   metadata, session isolation, dashboard graph rendering, and published
   LongMemEval guardrails.
4. Continue the pgGraph collaboration track for Postgres-native deployments and
   embedded packaging or library-mode options, but do not make pgGraph the
   default unless it beats the same gates without sidecar friction.
5. Continue LatticeDB evaluation as a first-class embedded candidate. Do not
   make it the default until the adapter passes the same contract, benchmark,
   and operations gates at representative scale.
