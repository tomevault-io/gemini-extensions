# Working on Smallibre

## Product direction

Build a small native macOS ebook manager: quick local import, useful metadata, restrained EPUB personalization, and reliable reader transfers. Prefer focused Swift implementations and system frameworks over adding runtimes or general-purpose conversion stacks. macOS is the target; cross-platform support is not an accepted requirement. GPL-3.0-only. A local ignored `calibre/` checkout may exist as reference material; it is not a dependency or shipped implementation.

Read the current code and README before using older design plans. Documents under `docs/superpowers/` include proposals and unimplemented stages. `docs/architecture/kindle-management.md` describes the first reader increment; `reader-reliability.md` supersedes its cache/helper/edit limitations.

## Architecture

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Sources/SmallibreApp` | SwiftUI interface with AppKit panels and WebKit preview. `AppModel` and `ReaderModel` are main-actor observable UI state. `Theme.swift` and `Components.swift` hold the design system: colour tokens, the cover artwork, shared rows, pills, form groups and button styles. Build screens from those instead of raw colours or ad-hoc chrome. |
| `Sources/SmallibreCore` | Book inspection, bounded ZIP handling, EPUB editing, SQLite library, metadata lookup, device operations and receipts. |
| `Sources/SmallibreReaderHelper` | Separate executable for potentially blocking mounted-device I/O; JSON request/response via `ReaderClient`. |
| `Sources/CSQLite`, `Sources/CZlib` | System library module maps; no downloaded package dependencies. |
| `Tests/SmallibreCoreTests` | Core regression tests and independently authored fixtures. |
| `Tests/SmallibreAppTests` | Library selection, editing, startup and reader gating regression tests. |
| `scripts/build-app.sh`, `Resources/Info.plist` | Release bundle assembly, helper inclusion, icon generation, identifiers and versions. |

`LibraryStore` is an actor owning library operations and its SQLite wrapper. Import stages a file, hashes it, detects/validates its format, deduplicates by SHA-256, saves its immutable original, and then inserts its database record. `EPUBEditor` prepares a separate archive; MOBI/AZW3 library exports keep original bytes. `MOBIMetadataEditor` only rewrites supported standalone device metadata, not book content.

Never put `fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)` on text inside a `NavigationSplitView` column: the column then reports an unbounded ideal height and every column is pushed out of the window. Verify interface changes by running the packaged app, not only by building it.

`ReaderModel` tracks connection state and serializes UI operations. `ReaderClient` starts the helper through `ReaderProcess`; `ReaderStore` performs device work. A process gate prevents overlapping helpers, with cancellation and deadlines. A kernel-blocked process can outlive a cancellation request: never interpret cancellation as proof a write did not happen.

## Invariants to preserve

- Keep imported originals immutable. Never overwrite an export destination. Back up and verify before device deletion or metadata replacement.
- Keep `BookOrganization` (tags, series/number, read state) library-only; organization edits must not change export bytes or conversion identity. Older records default to empty organization and unread.
- Bulk edits apply only explicitly chosen fields to visible selected books, rereading records and saving atomically. Keep single-book actions disabled for multiple selections and range anchors consistent across grid/list views.
- Use `LibraryQuery` for library search/filter semantics. Saved views persist query rules per library, not book IDs; device search remains separate.
- Identify books by bytes, not title. Revalidate file hashes, connection tokens and root identity before acting on cached device selections.
- Keep device I/O in the helper. Preserve path containment, symlink rejection and descriptor-relative mutation checks; do not simplify them to unchecked path operations.
- Preserve sidecars, annotations and device databases. Deletes are nonrecursive and apply only to selected files. KFX main-file backups are not complete package backups.
- Preserve operation receipts and uncertain outcomes. Do not automatically replay interrupted writes or remove uncertain staging files.
- Enable reader actions only after library initialization succeeds. `LibraryLocation` migrates legacy storage, preserves conflicting copies and repairs interrupted migration. Legacy names in migration and typography compatibility code are intentional.
- Treat ebook content as untrusted data. Keep resource limits, archive validation and XML protections. Current limits include 256 MB book/archive, 64 MB resource, 8 MB XML, and 10,000 ZIP entries; ZIP64 and DRM are unsupported.
- Preview uses `smallibre-book` URLs, sanitization, CSP and WebKit network blocking. Keep the scheme handler, navigation policy and content rules consistent; never enable book scripts or remote requests for convenience.
- Open Library lookup is explicit and bounded, with caching and throttling. Review suggestions before applying; no bulk automatic lookup on import.
- Device metadata writing supports a narrow set of DRM-free standalone layouts. Preserve unknown EXTH fields and all following records; reject unsupported/hybrid layouts rather than guessing.

## Build and verify

Requires macOS 14+ and a Swift 6 Xcode toolchain. From the repository root:

```sh
swift test
bash scripts/build-app.sh
codesign --verify --strict build/Smallibre.app
git diff --check
```

`swift test` builds the app/helper and tests. External-file/hardware tests skip unless opted in. The rename baseline was 45 tests: 41 passed, 4 skipped. Test counts are historical, not a hard-coded requirement. Use a focused `swift test --filter TestClassName` while iterating, then the relevant full suite for code changes. Documentation-only work needs link/content checks, not a new app build.

Packaging produces `build/Smallibre.app` for the host architecture, including `SmallibreReaderHelper`, icon, license and sample book. Signing is ad hoc: do not claim Developer ID signing, notarization, universal architecture support or a validated public release. CI currently uses `macos-latest`; it does not certify the minimum supported OS.

When publishing a release, also update and push `Casks/smallibre.rb` in `tajchert/homebrew-tap` with the new version and the published ZIP's verified SHA-256. GitHub releases do not update the cask automatically. Users need `brew update` before `brew upgrade --cask smallibre`.

Use a disposable library for manual development:

```sh
build/Smallibre.app/Contents/MacOS/Smallibre --library /tmp/smallibre-dev-library
```

Optional `--import /absolute/path/book.epub` imports into that library. Default storage is `~/Library/Application Support/Smallibre/`, including SQLite, `originals/`, `covers/`, `staging/`, reader cache and `reader-backups/`. Do not use a user's real library for destructive experiments.

External tests are explicit opt-ins; read their source before enabling:

- `SMALLIBRE_TEST_EPUB`: local EPUB round trip.
- `SMALLIBRE_TEST_FONT_EPUB` and `SMALLIBRE_TEST_FONT_OUTPUT`: convert a local EPUB with font fallback to a new local AZW3 file; preserve the source and never select a device output path.
- `SMALLIBRE_TEST_NATIVE_KINDLE` and `SMALLIBRE_TEST_NATIVE_KINDLE_LOCAL`: helper-only native AZW3 hardware workflow; use a new Mac-local evidence directory. Writes two authored copies, backs up/edits/deletes the second, and retains the first for physical reading.
- `SMALLIBRE_TEST_READER_SCAN`: device inventory scan.
- `SMALLIBRE_TEST_READER_BOOK` and `SMALLIBRE_TEST_READER_FOLDER`: mounted-reader transfer; writes a new copy.
- `SMALLIBRE_HARDWARE_DEVICE`, `SMALLIBRE_HARDWARE_SOURCE`, `SMALLIBRE_HARDWARE_LOCAL`: creates, edits and deletes a disposable device copy, with local backups.
- `SMALLIBRE_TEST_KINDLE_WORKFLOW` and `SMALLIBRE_TEST_KINDLE_WORKFLOW_LOCAL`: imports and personalizes the authored sample, prepares AZW3, transfers one new copy through the helper and verifies all existing books are preserved. Leaves the test book for manual reading.

Use temporary fixture folders by default. Real device writes require user authorization for that workflow; preserve existing books. Never commit personal ebooks, libraries, receipts, device dumps, signing material or generated builds. Use authored/minimal fixtures for regression coverage. Keep file mutation, disconnection and malformed-input tests meaningful; don't replace them with tests that merely mirror implementation.

## Workflow and boundaries

Keep changes focused, inspect existing work before editing, and commit completed increments when requested. Do not push, publish or rewrite Git history without authorization. Match the existing actor/Sendable boundaries; keep expensive work away from the main actor. Explain behavioral changes and validation in the final handoff.

The Swift package and bundles are named Smallibre; a developer's checkout folder may still use the old name. Do not hard-code local paths. Update README claims when capabilities change. Native bounded EPUB-to-AZW3 conversion, immutable artifact storage and mounted-Kindle export/send are implemented. See docs/architecture/epub-kindle-workflow.md for support limits. MTP transfers, automatic mirroring, one-click restore and 10k-book performance are not currently delivered.
