# sur9e — AI job-hunt command center

sur9e is a free, self-hosted, open-source job-hunt toolkit that runs inside
your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode) and ships
a local web UI on top of the same data. It evaluates job offers against your
real career profile, screens cheap before evaluating deep, tailors CVs, and
tracks every application — all on your machine.

**Mission:** quality over quantity. AI gives the job-seeker velocity and
clarity, never shortcuts — sur9e will never auto-submit an application.

This file is the **operating manual for the AI agent** (the agent IS the CLI —
read this on every session). The detailed human-and-agent contribution workflow
lives in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). This operating manual is stored as
both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`; keep those files byte-identical.

**Honesty rule:** never hallucinate. If unsure, state uncertainty. Say "I don't
know" rather than guess.

## Session start

1. Run silent update check: `node update-system.mjs check`. If
   `update-available`, surface to the user (see Update check protocol below).
2. If required user files are missing (`inputs/personalization/cv.md`,
   `inputs/personalization/profile.yml`) → enter onboarding
   (see [`docs/onboarding.md`](docs/onboarding.md)).
3. **Wizard handshake:** if the first user message is `Set me for success, baby!`
   — the playful line `npm run setup` seeds on hand-off — match its energy, then
   run onboarding ([`docs/onboarding.md`](docs/onboarding.md)). It's the wizard's
   launch signal, not a normal request.

## Architecture

Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + React 19 frontend, Server Actions for
mutations, with a thin Node-only library layer underneath. Detail in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

```
src/app/                  — Next.js App Router (routes + RSC pages + /api/* JSON compat)
src/features/<feature>/   — Feature-folder UI (profile, report, table, pipeline, analytics, settings)
src/components/primitives — Button, Input, Select, Card, Pill, Chip, Field, etc. (Radix-backed)
src/components/domain/    — StatusPill, ScoreChip, ActionsMenu (composed primitives)
src/components/modals/    — Apply, Screen, Evaluate, Followup, CV, CoverLetter, Research, Outreach
src/components/shell/     — Topbar, Rail, mobile-nav, chrome-effects
src/server/actions/       — Server Actions (applications, profile, settings, jobs)
src/server/revalidate.ts  — Type-safe wrapper around Next's revalidatePath
src/lib/server/           — Node-only loaders / writers / schemas (applications, profile, settings, reports, pipeline, usage, jobs)
src/lib/schemas/          — zod schemas shared by client + server
src/lib/api/              — fetchJson helper + tiny client/server bridges
src/lib/forms/            — useZodForm (rhf + zodResolver wrapper)
src/hooks/                — TanStack Query wrappers, useFocusTrap, useJobAction
src/stores/               — Zustand stores (drawer, selection, modal, toast, status-popover, etc.)
src/app/styles/           — Global CSS (tokens.css is the single source of truth for design tokens)
src/proxy.ts              — Next 16 proxy (was middleware.ts; no-op pass-through today)
inputs/personalization/   — User CV / profile / narrative / digest (gitignored)
inputs/config/            — Settings (gitignored)
content/modes/            — Agent mode prompts (one per evaluation type)
content/templates/        — PDF / CV / state templates
content/examples/         — Personalization templates new users copy from
cli/                      — Node CLI tools (doctor, verify-pipeline, generate-pdf, merge-tracker, etc.)
scripts/                  — Web launcher, setup migrations, maintainer tools
batch/                    — Headless workers: ATS portal + JobSpy scanning + screen/evaluate runners
artifacts/                — Generated reports / CV+cover-letter PDFs / interview-prep story bank (gitignored)
data/                     — Runtime state (applications.md, pipeline.md, jobs/, usage.json — gitignored)
test/                     — vitest unit tests + Playwright e2e (test/e2e/)
```

Dev server: `npm run web` → http://localhost:3000

## Critical rules (always)

- **NEVER auto-push.** Force push, branch deletion, and `git push` to remote require an explicit ask. Local commits are fine — make them logically grouped and well-described.
- **NEVER auto-submit applications.** Fill forms, draft answers, generate PDFs — but always STOP before Submit/Send/Apply.
- **Offer verification = Playwright, not WebFetch.** WebFetch can be spoofed by stale caches and bot-detection redirects; only Playwright (real headless browser) gives a faithful read of the live page.
- **Don't edit `content/modes/_shared.md` for user-specific content.** Customizations go in `inputs/personalization/narrative.md` or `inputs/personalization/profile.yml`. See [`docs/data-contract.md`](docs/data-contract.md).
- **Frontend visual changes require 3-width screenshot verification.** Capture desktop (1280×800), tablet (768×1024), and mobile (375×667) before claiming UI work is done. Every surface must work at all three widths.
- **Interface icons use Lucide.** Use the closest `lucide-react` icon through an existing shared primitive when one exists; do not hand-draw replacement SVGs, use Unicode/emoji glyphs as controls, or add a parallel icon library. Brand marks, company logos, data visualizations, and progress geometry are the only exceptions. Size and stroke icons through shared CSS/design tokens, mark decorative icons `aria-hidden`, and label icon-only controls.
- **Server library logic lives in `src/lib/server/`.** Don't grow Next API route handlers or server actions with business logic — extract into a `src/lib/server/<concern>.ts` module instead. Routes + actions are thin glue that parse zod schemas and call into the server library.
- **Server Actions handle mutations.** Each lives in `src/server/actions/<resource>.ts` and calls `revalidatePath(...)` (via the typed wrapper in `src/server/revalidate.ts`) for every surface the change affects. JSON endpoints under `src/app/api/*` stay as a compat surface for scripts.
- **Reads use the right cache layer.** RSC pages call `loadX(ROOT)` directly (wrapped in React `cache()` per request). Client components use TanStack Query hooks in `src/hooks/use-*`. Cross-component UI state goes in a Zustand store in `src/stores/`.
- **Design tokens live in `src/app/styles/tokens.css`.** New colors, spacing, radii, shadows, durations, and z-index tiers go there first; component CSS consumes `var(--token)`.

## Code-quality gates

| Layer                | Where                                                                    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PostToolUse hook** | [`.claude/hooks/post-edit-check.mjs`](.claude/hooks/post-edit-check.mjs) | Runs Biome on `.ts/.tsx/.mjs/.cjs/.js/.json/.css` and Prettier on `.md/.yml/.yaml` after every Edit/Write/MultiEdit. Errors come back as `additionalContext` next turn — the agent's "editor squigglies." |
| **Pre-commit hook**  | [`.githooks/pre-commit`](.githooks/pre-commit)                           | Runs `npm run test:quick` before every commit. Wired by `npm install`'s postinstall.                                                                                                                      |
| **Core CI**          | [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml)               | Uses Node 24 + `npm ci`, then runs the quick gate and production build as separate jobs on every PR and push to `main`.                                                                                   |

The full gate (`test-all.mjs`) covers syntax, scripts, data-contract invariants, parser fixtures, **lint + format** (Biome on TS/JS/CSS/JSON, Prettier on MD/YAML), **type-check** (`tsc` on `src/**`), and **vitest** (React + lib unit tests).

PR automation also runs a fresh-clone, data-independent Playwright smoke subset;
the user-data boundary; PR title and path-label policy; high-severity dependency
review; and CodeQL. External actions stay pinned to full commit SHAs. CodeRabbit
is conditional on its GitHub App being installed. If installed, it reviews
non-draft PRs to `main`; its findings remain actionable, but it is advisory for
merge gating and not a required check. Its request-changes workflow and
automatic/non-member chat stay disabled. During rollout, prohibit Autofix,
direct commits, stacked PRs, and code-editing chat commands. Dependabot opens
weekly npm and GitHub Actions PRs; never auto-merge them. See
[`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) for the maintainer workflow.

**Bypass for genuine emergencies:** `git commit --no-verify` for the pre-commit hook, `CLAUDE_SKIP_HOOK=1` for the PostToolUse hook. Use sparingly.

**npm scripts** follow a `namespace:command` convention — a bare verb for the one canonical action (`dev`, `build`, `lint`), `group:variant` when a noun has siblings. Run any with `npm run <name>`:

| Group           | Scripts                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| web             | `web` (dev) · `web:prod` · `web:tailscale` · `web:status` · `web:stop`     |
| build & quality | `build` · `build:analyze` · `lint` · `format` · `typecheck`                |
| test            | `test:quick` (full gate) · `test:unit` (vitest) · `test:e2e` (Playwright)  |
| tracker         | `tracker:verify` · `tracker:normalize` · `tracker:dedup` · `tracker:merge` |
| cv              | `cv:pdf` · `cv:sync-check`                                                 |
| update          | `update:check` · `update:apply` · `update:rollback`                        |
| jobs            | `scan` · `jobs:liveness`                                                   |
| other           | `doctor` · `setup` · `lighthouse`                                          |

## Development and release lifecycle

Before implementing, committing, pushing, or opening a PR for a repository
change, read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) in full. Treat each pull request
as the unit of history because this repository
squash-merges: one independently reviewable outcome per PR, with its required
implementation, tests, documentation, and tightly coupled refactoring together.
After explicit authorization to push and open PRs, publish each completed
independent PR promptly. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the source of truth for scope
decisions, split examples, commit style, and review expectations.

1. **Branch from current `main`.** Fetch first, then use a short-lived branch or
   isolated worktree. Never commit or push implementation work directly to
   `main`, and never overwrite unrelated user changes.
2. **Implement and verify locally.** Add or update tests with behavior changes.
   Before a PR, run `npm run test:quick` and `npm run build`; visual frontend
   changes also require the three screenshot widths in Critical rules.
3. **Open a reviewable PR.** Push only when explicitly asked. Use a valid
   Conventional Commit PR title, review the complete diff, and resolve
   actionable human or CodeRabbit findings. CodeRabbit is advisory. Review
   Dependabot PRs individually for compatibility and provenance; never
   auto-merge them.
4. **Wait for the protected checks.** Required checks are **Quick quality
   gate**, **Production build**, **Fresh-clone Playwright smoke**, **No private
   user data**, **Validate PR title**, **High-severity dependency gate**, and
   **CodeQL analysis**. Do not bypass, mark complete, or merge while a required
   check is pending or failing.
5. **Squash merge and clean up.** Keep the validated PR title as the squash
   header and the squash body blank. After verifying the merge, do not assume
   the PR removed its remote head branch: delete any remote or local branch only
   with explicit user authorization. Before removing a local worktree, confirm
   it is clean and contains no unique work.
6. **Let Release Please prepare releases.** Every push to `main` runs
   [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).
   Releasable Conventional Commits create or update a Release Please PR; an
   ordinary merge does not create a tag or GitHub release. `fix` and `perf`
   propose patch bumps, `feat` proposes a minor bump, and with the current
   pre-1.0 configuration a breaking change also proposes a minor bump. Other
   allowed types do not normally initiate a release. Never manually edit
   release-owned version files in an ordinary PR.
7. **Release by merging the release PR.** A maintainer reviews the proposed
   version, deterministic changelog, version-file synchronization, and checks,
   then squash-merges it. The workflow automatically creates `vX.Y.Z`, the
   GitHub release, non-AI release notes, and `sur9e.spdx.json`. Verify all four.
   Manual workflow dispatch is only for repairing the SBOM on an existing
   strict tag; it must not create a competing tag or release. This lifecycle
   does not publish npm packages, containers, or deployments.

## CV source of truth

`inputs/personalization/cv.md` is canonical. `inputs/personalization/article-digest.md` has detailed proof points (optional). **Read these at evaluation time** — never hardcode metrics into mode files.

## Contributing (humans and AI agents)

Humans and AI agents follow [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributor
ownership, PR scope, commit and PR style, validation, review, and AI-disclosure
requirements. The Critical rules and lifecycle gates in this manual remain
mandatory. Release work additionally follows [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md),
and security-sensitive work follows [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Update check protocol

On the first message of each session, run silently:

```bash
node update-system.mjs check
```

Parse the JSON output:

- `{"status": "update-available", "local": "...", "remote": "...", "changelog": "..."}` → tell the user:
  > "sur9e update available (v{local} → v{remote}). Your data (CV, profile, tracker, reports) will NOT be touched. Want me to update?"
  - If yes → `node update-system.mjs apply`
  - If no → `node update-system.mjs dismiss`
- `{"status": "up-to-date"}` → say nothing
- `{"status": "dismissed"}` → say nothing
- `{"status": "offline"}` → say nothing

The user can also say "check for updates" or "update sur9e" any time to force a check. Rollback: `node update-system.mjs rollback`.
