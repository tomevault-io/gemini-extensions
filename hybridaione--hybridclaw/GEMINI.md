# AGENTS.md — HybridClaw Engineering Protocol

This file is the canonical repo-level instruction set for coding agents working
in HybridClaw. Read it before any code change.

## Scope

- Follow this file first.
- If a deeper directory contains its own `AGENTS.md`, that file overrides this
  one for its subtree.
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` aligned with this file. `CLAUDE.md` should only carry
  tool-specific deltas.
- `templates/*.md` are product runtime workspace bootstrap files, not repo
  contributor onboarding docs.

## 1) Project Snapshot

HybridClaw is a personal AI assistant bot for Discord, powered by HybridAI.
Enterprise-grade Node.js 22 application with gateway service, TUI client, and
Docker-sandboxed container runtime.

**Version:** 0.12.6 &ensp;|&ensp; **Package:** `@hybridaione/hybridclaw`
&ensp;|&ensp; **License:** see `LICENSE`

Architecture: gateway (core runtime, SQLite persistence, REST API, Discord
integration) → container (Docker-sandboxed tool execution via file-based IPC) →
TUI (thin HTTP client). Agent workspaces are bootstrapped from `templates/` and
seeded with identity, memory, and context files managed by `src/workspace.ts`.

### Key Data Flows

```
User message → Gateway (HTTP/Discord) → ContainerInput (JSON)
  → Container spawns (Docker sandbox, file-based IPC)
    → Agent loop (tool calls, approvals, MCP)
  → ContainerOutput (JSON) → Gateway → User
  → Session persisted (SQLite), audit logged (wire.jsonl, hash-chained)
```

### Extension Points

| Extension     | Interface / Registration                                     | Playbook |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Skill         | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter                         | §7.1     |
| Provider      | `src/providers/<name>.ts` + factory                          | §7.2     |
| MCP Server    | `~/.hybridclaw/config.json` (`mcpServers.*`) → tool namespace | §7.3     |
| Approval rule | `.hybridclaw/policy.yaml`                                    | §7.4     |
| Template      | `templates/<name>.md` + `src/workspace.ts`                   | §7.5     |

### OpenTelemetry (Distributed Tracing)

The gateway supports optional OpenTelemetry instrumentation for distributed
tracing in cloud deployments. OTel is OFF by default (zero overhead).

| Env Var                          | Purpose                                                      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OTEL_ENABLED=true`             | Enable OTel SDK initialization                               |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`   | OTLP collector endpoint (also enables OTel if set)           |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`   | `grpc` (default) or `http/protobuf`                          |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`             | Service name reported in spans (default: `hybridclaw-gateway`)|

When enabled, spans are emitted for: gateway message handling, agent runs,
host/container execution, and skill loading. Trace context (traceId, spanId)
is injected into structured log lines for correlation.

Implementation: `src/observability/otel.ts`. The SDK packages
(`@opentelemetry/sdk-node`, exporters) are dynamically imported only when
OTel is active.

## 3) Engineering Principles

These are implementation constraints, not suggestions.

### 3.1 KISS

- Prefer straightforward control flow over abstraction.
- Keep error paths obvious and localized.
- Three similar lines of code is better than a premature helper.

### 3.2 YAGNI

- Do not add config keys, interfaces, or feature flags without a concrete caller.
- Do not add error handling for scenarios that cannot happen.
- Do not design for hypothetical future requirements.

### 3.3 DRY — Rule of Three

- Duplicate small local logic when it preserves clarity.
- Extract shared helpers only after three repeated, stable patterns.
- When extracting, preserve module boundaries.

### 3.4 Fail Fast

- Prefer explicit errors for unsupported or unsafe states.
- Never silently broaden permissions or capabilities.
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs, IPC); trust internal
  code.

### 3.5 Secure by Default

- LLM output is untrusted by default.
- Defaults are deny-by-default (mount allowlists, approval tiers, sandbox).
- Never log secrets, raw tokens, or sensitive payloads.
- Read `SECURITY.md` and `TRUST_MODEL.md` before touching security surfaces.

## 4) Risk Tiers by Path

Classify changes by blast radius. When uncertain, classify higher.

| Tier   | Paths                                                                       |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High   | `src/security/`, `src/gateway/`, `src/infra/`, `src/audit/`, `container/src/approval-policy.ts`, `container/src/extensions.ts`, `.hybridclaw/policy.yaml` |
| Medium | `src/agent/`, `src/providers/`, `src/session/`, `src/memory/`, `src/skills/`, `container/src/`, `templates/` |
| Low    | `docs/`, `skills/` (bundled SKILL.md), test additions, comments, formatting |

**High-risk changes** must include threat/risk notes and boundary/failure-mode
tests. **Medium-risk changes** need targeted test coverage. **Low-risk changes**
should verify no broken references.

---

## 5) Setup and Commands

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 (matches CI and `engines` field)
- npm
- Docker when working on container-mode behavior or image builds

### Common Commands

```bash
npm install                          # install deps + Husky hooks
npm run setup                        # install container/ deps
npm run build                        # compile root + container TypeScript
npm run typecheck                    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint                         # tsc --noEmit with unused detection
npm run check                        # biome check src
npm run format                       # biome check --write src
npm run test:unit                    # vitest unit suite
npm run test:integration             # integration tests
npm run test:e2e                     # end-to-end tests
npm run test:live                    # live tests (requires credentials)
npm run release:check                # verify release readiness
npm --prefix container run lint      # container lint
npm --prefix container run release:check  # container release check
npm run build:container              # build Docker image
```

### Dev Mode

```bash
npm run dev                          # tsx src/cli.ts gateway (hot reload)
npm run tui                          # tsx src/cli.ts tui
```

---

## 6) Working Rules

### Code Changes

- Keep changes focused. Prefer targeted fixes over broad refactors unless the
  task requires wider movement.
- Match the existing TypeScript + ESM patterns in the touched area.
- Update tests and docs when behavior, commands, or repo workflows change.
- Do not rename or relocate files in `templates/` without updating
  `src/workspace.ts` and the workspace bootstrap tests.
- Do not mix container and gateway changes in one commit unless they are
  tightly coupled.
- **README tone:** Describe the current state of the product, not changes
  relative to a prior version. Avoid "now", "no longer", "deprecated … for
  now", "recently added". The changelog is the place for transition language.

### Coding Style

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode, ES2022 target, NodeNext modules, ESM).
- **Formatting:** Biome is authoritative. Run `npm run format` before
  committing. The Husky pre-commit hook runs `npx biome check --write --staged`.
- **Single quotes** for strings (configured in `biome.json`).
- **No `any`** without strong justification. No `@ts-nocheck`.
- **File size:** aim for ~500 LOC; split when it improves clarity or
  testability. `src/skills/skills-guard.ts` and `src/skills/skills.ts` are
  current large exceptions — do not grow them further without splitting.
- **Comments:** brief comments for tricky or non-obvious logic only. Do not add
  comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you did not change.
- **Imports:** let Biome organize imports. Do not mix dynamic
  `await import()` and static `import` for the same module in production paths.
- **Dependencies:** root `package.json` is for gateway/CLI deps. Container-only
  deps go in `container/package.json`. Never add container deps to root.

### Git Discipline

- Treat existing uncommitted changes as user work unless you created them.
- Run `npm run format` before creating commits that will be pushed to GitHub.
- Conventional Commits preferred: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`,
  `chore:`, `docs:`.
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- Never commit real API keys, tokens, credentials, or personal data. Use
  neutral placeholders in tests: `"test-key"`, `"example.com"`, `"user_a"`.

## 7) Change Playbooks

### 7.1 Adding a Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with required frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: One-line description
   metadata:
     hybridclaw:
       category: development
   user-invocable: true  # optional, enables /<name> invocation
   ---
   ```
2. Add markdown instructions and working rules in the body.
3. If the skill needs supporting scripts, place them alongside `SKILL.md`.
4. Bundled script paths are mirrored into `/workspace/skills/<name>` at runtime.
5. Test: `hybridclaw skill list` should show the new skill.

Skill resolution order (first match wins):
1. `config.skills.extraDirs[]`
2. Bundled: `skills/<name>`
3. `$CODEX_HOME/skills`
4. `~/.codex/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`
5. Project/workspace: `./.agents/skills`, `./skills`

### 7.2 Adding a Provider

1. Create `src/providers/<name>.ts` implementing the provider interface.
2. Register in the provider factory (`src/providers/`).
3. Add config section in `src/config/` if new credentials or endpoints needed.
4. Add tests for factory wiring, error paths, and config parsing.
5. Update `docs/` if the provider is user-facing.

### 7.3 Adding an MCP Server

1. Add the server config to `~/.hybridclaw/config.json` under `mcpServers`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "<server-name>": {
         "command": "...",
         "args": ["..."],
         "transport": "stdio"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Tools are auto-discovered at startup and merged into the tool namespace.
3. Test with `hybridclaw` running in dev mode.

### 7.4 Modifying Approval Policy

1. Edit `.hybridclaw/policy.yaml`.
2. Approval tiers: green (silent) → yellow (narrated) → red (explicit approval).
3. `pinned_red` patterns are never auto-promoted.
4. Test approval flows with integration tests that exercise the boundary.

### 7.5 Modifying Templates

1. Edit the file in `templates/`.
2. **Always** update `src/workspace.ts` if you add, remove, or rename a
   template file.
3. Run workspace bootstrap tests to verify.
4. Remember: templates are seeded into agent workspaces at runtime — changes
   only apply to new sessions or after workspace reset.

### 7.6 Bump Release

When the user says "bump release":

1. Bump the requested semantic version (if unspecified, default to patch).
2. Update version strings in:
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json` (root `version` and `packages[""]`)
   - `container/package.json`
   - `container/package-lock.json` (root `version` and `packages[""]`)
   - any user-facing version text (for example `src/tui.ts` banner)
3. Move `CHANGELOG.md` release notes from `Unreleased` to the new version
   heading (or create one).
4. Update `README.md` "latest tag" link/text if present.
5. Commit with `chore: release vX.Y.Z`.
6. Create an annotated git tag `vX.Y.Z`.
7. Push the commit and tag.
8. Create or publish a GitHub Release entry for the tag using the same curated
   format as `v0.9.2`:
   - title: `HybridClaw vX.Y.Z`
   - `Release Date:` line with the calendar date
   - short blockquote summary paragraph
   - `Highlights`, `Changed`, and `Fixed` sections with polished bullets
   - `Contributors` section (`Core` and `All Contributors`)
   - trailing `Full Changelog` compare link
   - do not paste the raw `CHANGELOG.md` version heading/body verbatim

## 8) Testing Expectations

### What to Run

| Change scope        | Required checks                                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Docs only           | Verify links, commands, examples                            |
| `src/` changes      | `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, targeted Vitest suites |
| `container/` changes| `npm --prefix container run lint`, `npm run build`, IPC boundary tests |
| `skills/` changes   | `hybridclaw skill list`, targeted skill tests               |
| Release/packaging   | Both `release:check` scripts, verify versioned docs         |
| Security surfaces   | Include boundary and failure-mode tests                     |

### Conventions

- Test files: `tests/*.test.ts`, `*.integration.test.ts`, `*.e2e.test.ts`,
  `*.live.test.ts`.
- Live tests require credentials. Skip them unless your change needs them,
  and state that explicitly in your handoff.
- If you skip a relevant check, state what you skipped and why.
- Never hardcode real credentials in tests. Use env vars or test fixtures.

---

## 9) Anti-Patterns (Do Not)

- Do not rename or relocate `templates/` files without updating
  `src/workspace.ts`.
- Do not add container-only deps to root `package.json`.
- Do not grow `src/skills/skills-guard.ts` or `src/skills/skills.ts` further
  without splitting.
- Do not use `@ts-nocheck` or disable lint rules without strong justification.
- Do not silently weaken security policy, approval tiers, or mount allowlists.
- Do not log secrets, tokens, or sensitive payloads — even at debug level.
- Do not modify unrelated modules "while here".
- Do not include personal identity, real phone numbers, or live config values
  in tests, examples, docs, or commits.
- Do not edit `.dockerignore` without verifying the resulting Docker image
  still contains all runtime-required files (especially `docs/content/`).
  Build the image and confirm the affected paths exist inside it before
  marking the change complete.
- Do not edit `node_modules/` or vendored files.
- Do not break prompt caching: do not alter past context, change toolsets, or
  rebuild system prompts mid-conversation.
- Do not return stale or mocked data for security/audit paths.

---

## 10) Multi-Agent Safety

When multiple agents may be working on this repo concurrently:

- **Do not** create, apply, or drop `git stash` entries unless explicitly
  requested (including `git pull --rebase --autostash`).
- **Do not** switch branches or check out a different branch unless explicitly
  requested.
- **Do not** create, remove, or modify `git worktree` checkouts unless
  explicitly requested.
- When the user says "commit", scope to **your changes only**. When the user
  says "commit all", commit everything in grouped chunks.
- When the user says "push", you may `git pull --rebase` to integrate latest
  changes. Never discard other agents' work.
- When you see unrecognized files, keep going. Focus on your changes and commit
  only those.
- Focus reports on your edits. End with a brief "other files present" note only
  if relevant.
- Lint/format churn: if diffs are formatting-only, auto-resolve without asking.
  Only ask when changes are semantic (logic/data/behavior).

---

## 11) Documentation Hierarchy

| Document                    | Audience            | Purpose                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| `README.md`                 | End users           | Product overview, setup         |
| `AGENTS.md` (this file)     | Coding agents       | Canonical repo instructions     |
| `CLAUDE.md`                 | Claude Code          | Thin shim → `AGENTS.md`        |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`           | Human contributors  | Quickstart, PR workflow         |
| `SECURITY.md`               | Security reviewers  | Runtime security controls       |
| `TRUST_MODEL.md`            | Operators           | Trust acceptance policy         |
| `docs/content/`             | Maintainers         | User docs, developer guide, reference |
| `templates/*.md`            | Product runtime     | Agent workspace bootstrap       |

---

## 12) Handoff Template

When handing off work (agent → agent or agent → maintainer), include:

1. **What changed** — files touched and why.
2. **What did not change** — scope boundaries you respected.
3. **Validation** — which checks you ran and their results.
4. **Skipped checks** — what you did not run and why.
5. **Remaining risks / unknowns** — open questions or edge cases.
6. **Next recommended action** — what to do next.

---

## 13) Vibe Coding Guardrails

When working in fast iterative mode:

- Keep each iteration reversible (small commits, clear rollback path).
- Validate assumptions with code search before implementing.
- Prefer deterministic behavior over clever shortcuts.
- Do not "ship and hope" on security-sensitive paths.
- If uncertain about an internal API, search `src/` for existing usage patterns
  before guessing.
- If uncertain about architecture, read the type definitions in `src/types.ts`
  and the workspace bootstrap in `src/workspace.ts` before implementing.
