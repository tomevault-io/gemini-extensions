## AUDIT PIPELINE

When asked to audit a codebase, use the audit-orchestrator agent with one of three modes:

### Light Mode (~15 agents)
Fast scan for quick feedback. All sonnet agents. No fuzzing. Good for WIP code.

### Core Mode (~25 agents)
Full analysis with PoC verification for Medium+ findings. Mix of opus and sonnet.

### Thorough Mode (~40 agents)
Complete audit with invariant fuzzing, formal properties, multi-iteration depth analysis, and skeptic review for High/Critical findings.

### Pashov 12-Agent Pipeline
For comprehensive security review, use the `pashov-audit-pipeline` skill which runs 12 specialized attacker agents in parallel. Nine work a single lens — math precision, access control, economic security, execution trace, invariant, periphery, first principles, asymmetry, boundary — and three are gap-hunters (numerical, trust, flow) that report only bugs living at the seam between lenses. Findings are deduplicated, run through four judging gates, confidence-scored, and severity-classified with PoCs for Critical/High.

### Pre-Audit Reconnaissance
Use the `xray-pre-audit` skill to generate a structured pre-audit report (threat model, invariants, entry points, git analysis) before diving into line-by-line review. Its `x-ray.md` output is the best context package for both `pashov-audit-pipeline` and `fizz`.

### Stateful Fuzzing
Use the `fizz` skill to generate a full Echidna/Medusa invariant suite for a Foundry or Hardhat project — handlers, ghost variables, properties in plain English (`PROPERTIES.md`), coverage iteration, and Foundry reproduction tests for each violation. Use `fizz-sync` after source changes rather than regenerating, and `fizz-convert` to turn English properties into Solidity.

### Audit Phases
1. **Recon** — X-Ray pre-audit, scope, dependencies, architecture mapping, automated tools (Slither, Aderyn)
2. **Breadth** — Systematic contract-by-contract surface review, attack surface mapping
3. **Depth** — Deep analysis using specialized agents (state-trace, token-flow, edge-case, external)
4. **Chain** — Cross-contract interaction tracing, composability analysis
5. **Verification** — PoC construction for all Medium+ findings, severity classification
6. **Report** — Structured report with findings, executive summary, recommendations

## DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### New Protocol Feature
1. `planner` — Break down requirements, plan contract structure
2. `solidity-architect` — Design architecture, interfaces, storage layout
3. `foundry-tester` — Write tests first (TDD)
4. `solidity-engineer` — Implement contracts
5. `code-reviewer` — Review for security, gas, style
6. `verifier` — Final quality gate (build, test, snapshot, slither)
7. `contract-deployer` — Deploy and verify

### Bug Fix
1. `sleuth` — Investigate root cause with traces
2. `poc-writer` — Write PoC reproducing the bug
3. `solidity-engineer` — Implement fix
4. `foundry-tester` — Verify fix with existing + new tests
5. `verifier` — Quality gate

### Security Review
1. `audit-orchestrator` — Run audit pipeline (Light for quick, Core for thorough)
2. Depth agents analyze in parallel
3. `security-verifier` — Construct PoCs
4. `scribe` — Generate report

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **SECURITY FIRST** — Every function is a potential attack vector. Checks-effects-interactions always.
2. **FOUNDRY DEFAULT** — All testing, deployment, and analysis uses Foundry. Not Hardhat.
3. **VERIFY ADDRESSES** — Never hallucinate contract addresses. Use `cast code` to verify.
4. **DECIMAL AWARENESS** — USDC=6, WBTC=8, most=18. Always check. Use SafeERC20.
5. **NO SECRETS IN CODE** — No private keys, no API keys, no hardcoded secrets. Ever.
6. **NATSPEC REQUIRED** — All public/external functions must have NatSpec documentation.
7. **TEST BEFORE DEPLOY** — forge build + forge test + forge snapshot --check + slither before any deployment.
8. **GAS CONSCIOUSNESS** — Measure with forge snapshot. Optimize storage packing, calldata, immutables.
9. **CURRENT KNOWLEDGE** — Gas is under 1 gwei (2026). EIP-7702 is live. Foundry is default. Pectra/Fusaka shipped.
