# Fermix

## Project
Elixir-native multi-agent AI platform. Phoenix gateway, OTP-supervised agents, Rustler NIFs for crypto/tokenization only.

**Stack:** Elixir, Phoenix, OTP, Rustler, SQLite
**Predecessor:** RustyClaw — reference for channels, tools, providers

## Behavioral Guidance
- The approved design is the plan. Implement against it, do not quietly re-design the task mid-flight.
- Don't assume. State assumptions explicitly before coding. If multiple interpretations exist, surface them instead of picking silently.
- If the request or design is unclear, stop and ask. If repo reality conflicts with the design, surface the mismatch before coding.
- Prefer the simplest correct solution. No speculative abstractions, no extra flexibility, no "while I'm here" cleverness.
- Make surgical changes. Touch only what the request requires. Mention unrelated issues, don't fix them unless asked.
- For multi-step work, define success in `step -> verify` form and keep going until the checks pass.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

## Execution Contract
- If changing behavior, write or update a failing test first.
- Implement the smallest change that satisfies the design.
- Run the relevant repo commands below before calling the work done. Default expectation: typecheck or build, tests, and lint.
- For docs, config, or scaffolding changes, run the relevant checks and say what is not applicable.
- When a change adds, removes, or materially alters a feature, capability, tool, channel, provider, config surface, or CLI verb, update the `self_knowledge` skill (`apps/fermix_core/priv/skills/self_knowledge/SKILL.md`) in the same change. It is Fermix's runtime self-reference for explaining and fixing itself, and goes stale silently otherwise.
- When adding/altering a **tool, provider, or run-type**, route its telemetry through the shared emitters so it stays correlatable (and Opik-traceable) — tool events via `FermixCore.Tools.Telemetry.exec/5`, provider calls via `FermixCore.Providers.Telemetry.emit_call/3`; **never** hand-roll `:telemetry.execute([:fermix, :tool|provider, ...])`. A new run-type needs a unique `session_id` (+ `parent_session` if spawned) and lifecycle bookend events; a genuinely new event name/run-kind also needs a `FermixOpik` update (the in-umbrella `apps/fermix_opik`). See `docs/TELEMETRY_CONTRACT.md`.
- Never mark work done without proof.

## Code Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Linear flow.** Max 2 nesting levels. Top to bottom.
2. **Bound loops.** Explicit max on retries, polls, recursion. Define cap behavior.
3. **Small functions.** 40-60 lines max. One job per function.
4. **Own resources.** Open → close on every path, including errors.
5. **Narrow state.** No module globals. Pass deps explicitly.
6. **Assert assumptions.** Guards and validation on every public function. Fail loud.
7. **Never swallow errors.** No bare `rescue`. No `{:error, _} -> :ok`. Log, raise, or return.
8. **Visible side effects.** I/O obvious at call site. Separate pure from effectful.
9. **Minimal indirection.** Readable > elegant. One layer of abstraction max.
10. **Surgical changes only.** Touch only what the request requires. Do not refactor adjacent code, comments, or formatting unless the task needs it. Remove only the dead code your change creates.
11. **Warnings = errors.** Linters, typecheckers, analyzers are hard gates. Zero warnings.
12. **No fallbacks.** One code path per behavior. Do not add a "fallback" branch that silently retries with a different mechanism, reads from a deprecated location, or degrades to a partially-working state when the primary path fails. Fallbacks double the surface area, hide which path actually ran, mask real failures behind "it kind of worked," and turn every bug into a five-branch investigation. The old flow is dead the moment the new flow ships — delete it; do not keep it as a safety net. If the primary path fails, fail loud at the boundary with a clear message and exit non-zero. Two valid configurations are fine (e.g., user-scope vs system-scope service); two paths to handle one configuration is not. If you think you need a fallback, you actually need (a) a clearer error message, (b) a single failure-recovery step for a destructive op (e.g., upgrade rollback — explicitly scoped, no user-facing chain), or (c) a different design that doesn't have the failure mode at all.

## Conventions
- `@callback` for all plugin interfaces (providers, channels, tools)
- `{:ok, result} | {:error, reason}` tuples, not exceptions
- GenServer callbacks thin — delegate to private functions
- No business logic in Phoenix controllers
- Typespecs on all public functions

## Commands
```sh
mix deps.get && mix compile
mix test
mix credo --strict
mix format --check-formatted
```

## Known Pitfalls
- Update this section every time the repo teaches you the same lesson twice.
- **Test cleanup wiped the host (M5-shaped pass, 2026-04).** Codex generated a unit test whose `on_exit` hook called `File.rm_rf!(dir)` on a computed path; an empty interpolation collapsed `dir` to a root path and the host filesystem was wiped during `mix test`. **Rule:** never call `File.rm_rf` / `File.rm_rf!` / `File.rm` / `File.rm!` directly in `test/`. Route through `FermixCore.TestSupport.SafeRm.rm_rf!/1` (lands in M5 Stage 0), which hard-asserts the path is under a tmp prefix with ≥4 segments and no `..`. Sandbox tests must also never call `System.cmd` or `Port.open` — classify dangerous commands as strings via `Sandbox.classify/3`, never execute them. See `docs/MILESTONE_5_WORKSPACE_SANDBOX.md` §11.
- **Tests overwrote real keychain secrets (secure-on-save, 2026-06).** When secure-on-save landed, tests that persisted config snapshots with fixture secrets ran against the real macOS `security` writer (`-U` updates in place) and clobbered the operator's actual keyring entries (`fermix:OPENAI_API_KEY`, `fermix:TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) — silently green locally, 24 failures on writer-less Linux CI. **Rule:** any test that can reach `SecretWriter` must run against `FermixTestSupport.SecretWriterStub` — `config/test.exs` now sets it as the test-env default; never delete that default, and tests exercising the writer-less path override with `UnavailableSecretWriter`, not by removing the stub. Same family as the SafeRm rule: tests must never mutate host state (filesystem, keychain, real `FERMIX_HOME`).
- **Order-dependent test flake from leaked global app env (hermetic-config, 2026-06).** Two `async: false` tests asserted defaults that depend on global `Application` env they never established themselves, so an earlier module's leaked env flipped them — green locally, red on CI only under the right seed/`max_cases` (run 27104818459, seed 587472). `RouteResolverTest` "sane defaults" read `Config.provider/1` (global `:fermix_core, :providers`) and a leaked `anthropic: [auth_mode: "oauth"]` made the default resolve `:oauth` instead of `:api_key`; `Jobs.TelemetryTest` "run_start" `refute`d a captured `:input` but a leaked `:telemetry capture_content: true` attached it. **Rule:** a test asserting "the default when nothing is configured" or "X is NOT captured" must *establish* that precondition in its own `setup` (force `:providers`/`:agent`/`:telemetry` to the production baseline and restore on `on_exit`) — never assume the global env is clean. Reproduce these deterministically with a throwaway polluter module whose top-level `put_env` dirties app env before ExUnit runs. Same family as the SafeRm / keychain rules: tests must neither mutate nor silently depend on un-isolated host/global state.
- **No unnecessary env overlays.** Don't invent an env var to override a *setting* the config already owns — that's a fallback: a second code path that drifts from the config and rots when the config model evolves. If clean config-driven design covers it, that *is* the design. An env overlay is justified only for a secret or to gate a new feature behind a flag; everything else is a setting and lives in `config.toml`. (Rule #12, applied to config.)
- **Opik exported empty traces during `mix test` (env flag beat the env gate, 2026-06).** `FERMIX_OPIK_ENABLED=1` exported in the dev shell (needed for the daemon + eval skill) switched the exporter on inside `mix test`: the `only: [:dev, :prod]` dep gating in `fermix_core/mix.exs` only stops *fermix_core* from auto-starting opik, but `fermix_opik` is a **sibling umbrella app** whose `Application` still boots in `:test`, read the flag, attached the global telemetry `Reporter`, and POSTed every fixture's telemetry as near-empty traces. **Rule:** a feature flag is not an environment gate — an env-only switch can't tell `:dev`/`:prod` from `:test`. Gate "should this run at all" on the **compile-time env** (`@compiled_env Mix.env()`, release-safe), then let the flag decide within the allowed envs. Fixed in `8bc080f`: `FermixOpik.enabled?/0` is `@compiled_env != :test and enabled_by_flag?()`, so `mix test` never exports regardless of the flag. Same family as the host-state test rules: a test run must neither mutate nor export to live infra.

## Preserved Project-Specific Notes
These notes came from the previous `CLAUDE.md`. Keep the template above as the primary operating guide, and use the preserved context below where it is still relevant.

## Architecture
```

├── apps/fermix_core/       # Agents, providers, tools, memory
├── apps/fermix_channels/   # Telegram (only channel implemented so far)

```

- One BEAM VM, no HTTP bridge. Everything is OTP-supervised.
- Persistent Main Agent (GenServer, `:permanent`) with single-flight per conversation
- Agent loop: LLM call → parse tool calls → execute → loop until done
- Providers via Req. Memory is in-memory (ConversationStore GenServer + ETS Store).

## Observability (Every Task)
Every component must emit structured traces. This is not optional.
- LLM calls → `:telemetry.execute([:fermix, :provider, :call], measurements, metadata)`
- Tool executions → `:telemetry.execute([:fermix, :tool, :exec], ...)`
- Channel messages → `:telemetry.execute([:fermix, :channel, :message], ...)`
- Agent lifecycle → `Trace.record(:agent_event, agent, data)`
- Errors → always traced before returning `{:error, reason}`

Traces write to `~/.fermix/traces/YYYY-MM-DD/` as JSONL. See `FermixCore.Trace`.
