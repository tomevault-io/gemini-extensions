# Multi Agent Architecture

# Multi-Agent Architecture

The Chat USD system is built on a multi-agent architecture that enables it to handle a wide range of USD-related tasks by routing queries to specialized agents.

## Query Routing Process

The query routing process in Chat USD follows these steps:

1. **User Query Analysis**: The `ChatUSDSupervisorNode` analyzes the user's query to determine its intent
2. **Agent Selection**: Based on the intent, the supervisor selects the appropriate specialized agent
3. **Query Reformulation**: The supervisor reformulates the query for the selected agent
4. **Agent Execution**: The selected agent processes the reformulated query
5. **Response Integration**: The supervisor integrates the agent's response into a coherent reply
6. **Iterative Refinement**: If needed, the supervisor may route follow-up queries to other agents

## System Message Design

The system message for the `ChatUSDSupervisorNode` is a critical component of the multi-agent architecture. It provides detailed instructions on:

1. **Available Expert Functions**: Describes the capabilities of each specialized agent
2. **Function Calling Guidelines**: Explains how to call each function effectively

# Component Interactions

# Component Interactions

This document explains how the different components of Chat USD interact with each other to provide a comprehensive USD development assistant.

## Interaction Flow

The interaction flow in Chat USD follows these steps:

1. **User Input**: The user provides a query through the chat interface
2. **ChatUSDNetworkNode Processing**: The query is processed by the ChatUSDNetworkNode
3. **Supervisor Analysis**: The ChatUSDSupervisorNode analyzes the query to determine its intent
4. **Agent Selection**: The supervisor selects the appropriate specialized agent
5. **Agent Processing**: The selected agent processes the query
6. **Response Integration**: The supervisor integrates the agent's response
7. **Final Response**: The integrated response is returned to the user

## Message Passing

Components in Chat USD interact through message passing, using the message types defined in the LC Agent framework:

1. **HumanMessage**: Represents user input
2. **AIMessage**: Represents AI-generated responses
3. **SystemMessage**: Provides instructions to the AI
4. **ToolMessage**: Represents the output of tool calls

Messages flow through the system as follows:

```
User Input (HumanMessage)
       ↓
ChatUSDNetworkNode
       ↓
ChatUSDSupervisorNode (SystemMessage + HumanMessage)
       ↓
Specialized Agent (SystemMessage + HumanMessage)
       ↓
Agent Response (AIMessage)
       ↓
ChatUSDSupervisorNode (AIMessage)
       ↓
Final Response (AIMessage)
```

## Supervisor-Agent Interactions

The interaction between the supervisor and specialized agents is a key aspect of Chat USD. The supervisor:

1. **Analyzes Queries**: Determines the intent of user queries
2. **Selects Agents**: Chooses the appropriate agent for each query
3. **Reformulates Queries**: Adapts queries for the selected agent
4. **Integrates Responses**: Combines responses from multiple agents

## Agent-Agent Interactions

In some cases, agents may need to interact with each other to provide a comprehensive response. For example:

1. **SceneInfo → USDCodeInteractive**: The SceneInfo agent provides scene information that the USDCodeInteractive agent uses to generate code
2. **USDSearch → USDCodeInteractive**: The USDSearch agent provides asset information that the USDCodeInteractive agent uses to import assets

These interactions are coordinated by the supervisor, which routes queries and responses between agents as needed.

## Modifier Interactions

Modifiers play a crucial role in extending the functionality of Chat USD components. They interact with components by:

1. **Intercepting Messages**: Modifiers can intercept messages before they are processed by a component
2. **Modifying Behavior**: Modifiers can change how a component processes messages
3. **Enhancing Responses**: Modifiers can add information to component responses

class USDSearchNetworkNode(NetworkNode):
    """
    Use this node to search any asset in Deep Search. It can search, to import call another tool after this one.
    """

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        # Add the USDSearchModifier to the network
        self.add_modifier(USDSearchModifier())

        # Set the default node to USDSearchNode
        self.default_node = "USDSearchNode"

        self.metadata[
            "description"
        ] = """Agent to search and Import Assets.
Connect to the USD Search NIM to find USD assets base on the natural language query.
Drag and drop discovered assets directly into your scene for seamless integration"""

        self.metadata["examples"] = [
            "What can you do?",
            "Find 3 traffic cones and 2 Boxes",
            "I need 3 office chairs",

```

## USDSearchModifier

The `USDSearchModifier` is a key component of the `USDSearchNetworkNode`. It extends `NetworkModifier` and is responsible for intercepting search queries, calling the USD Search API, and processing the results:

```python
class USDSearchModifier(NetworkModifier):
    """USDSearch API Command:
    @USDSearch(query: str, metadata: bool, limit: int)@
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self._settings = carb.settings.get_settings()
        self._service_url = self._settings.get("exts/omni.ai.chat_usd.bundle/usd_search_host_url")
        self._api_key = get_api_key()

    def on_post_invoke(self, network: "RunnableNetwork", node: RunnableNode):
        output = node.outputs.content if node.outputs else ""
        matches = re.findall(r'@USDSearch\("(.*?)", (.*?), (\d+)\)@', output)

        search_results = {}
        for query, metadata, limit in matches:
            # Cast to proper Python types
            metadata = metadata.lower() == "true"
            limit = int(limit)

            # Call the actual USD Search API
            api_response = self.usd_search_post(query, metadata, limit)
            search_results[query] = api_response
```

## Search Process

The search process in `USDSearchNetworkNode` follows these steps:

1. **Query Generation**: The `USDSearchNode` generates a search query based on the user's natural language description
2. **Query Interception**: The `USDSearchModifier` intercepts the search query
3. **API Call**: The modifier calls the USD Search API with the query
4. **Result Processing**: The modifier processes the API response
5. **Result Presentation**: The results are presented to the user

# Scene Info Network Node

# SceneInfoNetworkNode

The `SceneInfoNetworkNode` is a specialized agent in the Chat USD system that handles scene information retrieval. It extends the `NetworkNode` class from the LC Agent framework.

## Implementation

```python
class SceneInfoNetworkNode(NetworkNode):
    """
    Use this function to get any information about the scene.

    Use it only in the case if the user wants to write ascript and you need information about the scene.

    For example use it if you need the scene hirarchy or the position of objects.

    Always use it if the user asked for an object in the scene and didn't provide the exact name.

    Never use USDCodeInteractiveNetworkNode if the exact name is not known.
    Use SceneInfoNetworkNode to get the name first and use USDCodeInteractiveNetworkNode when the name is known.

    Use this function to get any size or position of the object.
    """

    default_node: str = "SceneInfoGenNode"
    code_interpreter_hide_items: Optional[List[str]] = None

    def __init__(
        self,
        question: Optional[str] = None,
        enable_interpreter_undo_stack=True,
        enable_rag=True,
        max_retries: Optional[int] = None,
        **kwargs,
    ):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

        if max_retries is None:
            max_retries = 15

        self.add_modifier(SceneInfoPromoteLastNodeModifier())
        self.add_modifier(NetworkLenghtModifier(max_length=max_retries))
        self.add_modifier(CodeExtractorModifier())
        self.add_modifier(
            DoubleRunUSDCodeGenInterpreterModifier(
                success_message="This is some scene information:\n",
                hide_items=self.code_interpreter_hide_items,
                undo_stack=enable_interpreter_undo_stack,
                first_run=False,
            )
        )
        if enable_rag:
            self.add_modifier(USDCodeGenRagModifier())

        if question:
            with self:
                RunnableHumanNode(human_message=human_message.format(question=question))
```

## Scene Information Retrieval Process

The scene information retrieval process in `SceneInfoNetworkNode` follows these steps:

1. **Query Analysis**: The user's query is analyzed to understand what information is needed
2. **Script Generation**: A script is generated to retrieve the necessary information
3. **Script Execution**: The script is executed to retrieve the information
4. **Information Formatting**: The retrieved information is formatted for presentation
5. **Response Generation**: A response is generated with the formatted information

## Importance in the Chat USD System

The `SceneInfoNetworkNode` plays a critical role in the Chat USD system, as it provides the foundation for accurate and effective code generation. By retrieving information about the current state of the scene, it enables the system to generate code that is tailored to the specific scene, rather than generic code that may not work correctly.

# Modifiers

# Chat USD Modifiers

Modifiers are a key architectural component in the Chat USD system that extend the functionality of network nodes. They intercept and modify messages, execute code, process results, and enhance the overall capabilities of the system.

## Core Modifier Types

### Code Execution Modifiers

#### DoubleRunUSDCodeGenInterpreterModifier

The `DoubleRunUSDCodeGenInterpreterModifier` executes code snippets and handles errors. It is used by both the `USDCodeInteractiveNetworkNode` and the `SceneInfoNetworkNode`.

This modifier executes code snippets in two phases:
1. First run: Check for errors
2. Second run: Execute the code

#### CodeExtractorModifier

The `CodeExtractorModifier` extracts code snippets from responses. It identifies code blocks in the response and extracts them for execution.

### Scene Information Modifiers

#### SceneInfoModifier

The `SceneInfoModifier` is a specialized modifier used by the `USDCodeInteractiveNetworkNode` to retrieve scene information before generating code. It calls the `SceneInfoNetworkNode` to retrieve information about the current USD scene.

This modifier ensures that the `USDCodeInteractiveNetworkNode` has access to information about the current USD scene before generating code, leading to more accurate and effective code generation.

#### USDCodeGenRagModifier

The `USDCodeGenRagModifier` enhances scene information retrieval with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base to improve the quality of the generated code.

### Search Modifiers

#### USDSearchModifier

The `USDSearchModifier` is a key modifier in the Chat USD system that handles USD asset searches. It intercepts search queries, calls the USD Search API, and processes the results.

This modifier ensures that search queries are properly processed and the results are presented to the user in a useful format.

### Network Management Modifiers

#### NetworkLenghtModifier

The `NetworkLenghtModifier` controls the maximum length of the network. It is used by both the `USDCodeInteractiveNetworkNode` and the `SceneInfoNetworkNode` to prevent the network from growing too large.

# Extending

# Extending the Chat USD System

This document provides guidance on how to extend the Chat USD system to add new functionality, customize existing components, or integrate with other systems.

## Overview

The Chat USD system is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add new functionality, customize existing components, or integrate with other systems. This extensibility is achieved through a modular architecture that separates concerns and provides clear extension points.

The main extension points in the Chat USD system include:

1. **Adding New Network Nodes**: Create specialized agents for specific tasks
2. **Adding New Modifiers**: Extend the functionality of network nodes
3. **Customizing System Messages**: Modify the behavior of existing nodes
4. **Integrating with Other Systems**: Connect the Chat USD system with other systems
5. **Customizing the UI**: Modify the user interface to suit specific needs

## Adding New Network Nodes

To add a new network node, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Node Class**: Create a new Python class that extends the `NetworkNode` class from the LC Agent framework.

```python
from lc_agent import NetworkNode

class MyCustomNetworkNode(NetworkNode):
    """My Custom Network Node"""

    default_node: str = "MyCustomNode"

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # Add modifiers or other initialization code here
```

2. **Register the Node**: Register the node with the node factory in the extension's initialization code.

```python
def _register_nodes(self):
    """Register the nodes with the node factory"""
    # Get the node factory
    node_factory = get_node_factory()

    # Register the custom node
    node_factory.register(
        MyCustomNetworkNode,
        name="ChatUSD_MyCustom",
        custom_param=True,
        hidden=True,
    )
```

3. **Update the Route Nodes**: Update the `route_nodes` dictionary in the `ChatUSDNetworkNode` class to include the new node.

4. **Update the System Message**: Update the system message of the `ChatUSDSupervisorNode` to include instructions for the new node.

## Adding New Modifiers

To add a new modifier, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Modifier Class**: Create a new Python class that extends the `NetworkModifier` class from the LC Agent framework.

```python
from lc_agent import NetworkModifier

class MyCustomModifier(NetworkModifier):
    """My Custom Modifier"""

    def __init__(self, custom_param=True):
        self.custom_param = custom_param

    def on_pre_invoke(self, network, inputs):
        """Called before the network is invoked"""
        # Modify the node before they are processed by the network

    def on_post_invoke(self, network, result):
        """Called after the network is invoked"""
        # Modify the result after it is processed by the network
```

2. **Add the Modifier to a Node**: Add the modifier to a node in the node's initialization code.

```python
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(**kwargs)

    # Add the custom modifier
    self.add_modifier(MyCustomModifier(custom_param=True))
```

## Customizing System Messages

To customize a system message, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the System Message**: Identify the system message you want to customize. System messages are typically defined as constants in the node's module.

2. **Modify the System Message**: Modify the system message to suit your needs. Be careful to maintain the overall structure and intent of the message.
