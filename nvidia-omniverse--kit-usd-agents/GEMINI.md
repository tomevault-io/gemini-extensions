    def on_pre_invoke(self, network: "RunnableNetwork", node: "RunnableNode"):
        # Inject metafunction information
```

This modifier is crucial for the interactive development experience, enabling users to leverage pre-defined functions for common tasks.

## Modifier Interactions

The modifiers in the LC Agent USD module work together in a coordinated pipeline:

1. **Pre-Invoke Phase**:
   - RAG modifiers inject relevant knowledge
   - MFRagModifier provides metafunction information

2. **Post-Invoke Phase**:
   - CodeExtractorModifier extracts code snippets
   - CodeInterpreterModifier executes the code
   - USDCodeGenPatcherModifier patches issues
   - NetworkLengthModifier controls iteration count

This pipeline ensures that each aspect of USD development is handled by specialized components working together.

## Customizing Modifiers

Modifiers can be customized in several ways:

1. **Configuration Options**: Most modifiers accept configuration options in their constructors
2. **Selective Enabling**: Network nodes can selectively enable or disable modifiers
3. **Custom Implementations**: New modifiers can be created by extending `NetworkModifier`
4. **Modifier Ordering**: The order of modifiers can be controlled through priority settings

Example of customizing modifiers:

```python
# Create a network node with custom modifier configuration
node = USDCodeGenNetworkNode(
    show_stdout=True,              # Show execution output
    snippet_verification=True,     # Verify code snippets
    use_code_fixer=True,           # Use the code fixer
    retriever_name="custom_retriever"  # Use a custom retriever
)

# Add a custom modifier with specific priority
node.add_modifier(CustomModifier(), priority=100)
```

## Performance Considerations

When working with modifiers, consider:

1. **Modifier Stack**: Each additional modifier increases processing time
2. **RAG Operations**: Knowledge retrieval adds latency but improves quality
3. **Code Execution**: Running code validation increases response time
4. **Error Handling**: Complex error handling in modifiers can impact performance

To optimize performance:

1. Only enable necessary modifiers
2. Configure RAG modifiers with appropriate token limits
3. Use network length modifiers to prevent excessive iterations
4. Consider disabling code execution for simple queries

## Best Practices

When working with modifiers in the LC Agent USD module:

1. **Understand the Pipeline**: Know how modifiers interact in the execution pipeline
2. **Configure Appropriately**: Set appropriate configuration options for your use case
3. **Selective Enabling**: Only enable modifiers that are necessary for your task
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling in custom modifiers
5. **Testing**: Test modifier combinations to ensure they work together effectively

## Example: Complete Modifier Stack

Here's an example of a complete modifier stack for advanced USD code generation:

```python
# Create a network node with a comprehensive modifier stack
node = USDCodeGenNetworkNode()

# Network management
node.add_modifier(NetworkLengthModifier(max_length=5))

# Code extraction and validation
node.add_modifier(CodeExtractorModifier(snippet_verification=True))

# Knowledge enhancement
node.add_modifier(USDCodeGenRagModifier(code_atlas_for_human=True))

# Code execution and patching
node.add_modifier(CodeInterpreterModifier(show_stdout=True))
node.add_modifier(USDCodeGenPatcherModifier())
node.add_modifier(CodeFixerModifier())

# Quality evaluation
node.add_modifier(JudgeModifier())
```
