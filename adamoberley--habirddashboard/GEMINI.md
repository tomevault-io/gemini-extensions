# AGENTS.md — generate bird illustrations for your location

**This repo's main agent-assisted task:** generate kachō-e illustrations for
the bird species at *your* location (the ones the bundled library is missing),
in the same style as the rest, and get them into the card.

A human can hand their AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) this one
line:

> "Follow AGENTS.md to generate bird illustrations for my birds."

The agent should then work through the steps below, pausing only at the points
marked **ASK THE USER**. (Contributor build/test notes are at the very bottom.)

---

## 0. Prerequisites — ASK THE USER first

- **A billing-enabled Google Gemini API key.** Image generation is **not** on
  the free tier — a free key returns `HTTP 429 ... quota ... limit: 0`. Get one
  at <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey> and **enable billing** on its project.
  Cost is roughly **$0.04 per image** (2 images per species); a typical missing
  set runs a few dollars.
- **Python 3.10+** (always) and **Node 18+** (only to rebuild the card).
- Their **BirdNET-Go species list** — Step 1.

Don't generate anything until the user confirms a billing-enabled key. That 429
is the #1 thing that wastes a run.

---

## 1. Get the species list for your location

Pick one:

**A. Download the CSV from the BirdNET-Go dashboard** *(recommended — covers
every species likely at your location, not just what's been heard so far).*

1. Open your BirdNET-Go web UI (e.g. `http://homeassistant.local:8080`).
2. Go to the **Species** page — the per-location species list (each with an
   occurrence score). Use its **export / download** to save a **CSV**.
3. Any CSV with `Common Name` and `Scientific Name` columns works (other
   columns are ignored). Note the file path.

**B. Pull straight from the station** *(no download).* Skip the CSV and let the
pipeline read exactly what your station has detected:
`--from-birdnet http://<your-birdnet-go>:8080` (used in Step 3). Use this only
if the machine running the agent can reach your BirdNET-Go.

---

## 2. One-time setup

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r avian/scripts/requirements.txt certifi
```

**macOS only:** the system Python often can't verify HTTPS, which silently
breaks the Wikipedia + Gemini calls (`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`). Export a CA
bundle for **every** pipeline command in this session:

```bash
export SSL_CERT_FILE="$(.venv/bin/python -m certifi)"
```

Provide the Gemini key without putting it in shell history or git:

```bash
echo 'YOUR_GEMINI_KEY' > avian/scripts/.gemini_key   # already gitignored
export GEMINI_API_KEY="$(tr -d '[:space:]' < avian/scripts/.gemini_key)"
```

### Style references — do this; it's what keeps your birds matching the set

The bundled art was generated with ~10 public-domain Edo-period kachō-e
woodblock prints as a *style* reference (only the painting technique is
borrowed). They aren't committed (third-party scans). Fetch them:

```bash
mkdir -p avian/assets/references/styles
UA="habird-styleref/1.0 (+https://github.com/adamoberley/HABirdDashboard)"
while IFS='|' read -r fn url; do
  curl -sSL -A "$UA" -o "avian/assets/references/styles/$fn" "$url"
done <<'REFS'

# Shrink to ~1024px so each API request stays small:
.venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
from PIL import Image
for f in sorted(Path("avian/assets/references/styles").glob("*.jpg")):
    im = Image.open(f).convert("RGB"); w, h = im.size
    if max(w, h) > 1024:
        s = 1024 / max(w, h); im = im.resize((round(w*s), round(h*s)), Image.LANCZOS)
    im.save(f, "JPEG", quality=88, optimize=True)
PY
```

(Generation still works without these, but the style drifts from the bundled
set — so don't skip it if you want them to match.)

---

## 3. Generate → cut out → masks → card

If you used the **CSV** (option A), convert it to the `Sci|Com` label format the
pipeline reads (skip if using `--from-birdnet`):

```bash
.venv/bin/python - "PATH/TO/your-list.csv" <<'PY' > avian/scripts/mybirds.txt
import csv, sys
for r in csv.DictReader(open(sys.argv[1])):
    sci = (r.get("Scientific Name") or "").strip()
    com = (r.get("Common Name") or "").strip()
    if sci and com:
        print(sci + "|" + com)
PY
```

**Generate** — renders each bird on a flat cream ground. It **skips species
already illustrated**, so only the ones your library is missing cost anything:

```bash
.venv/bin/python avian/scripts/pregen.py --labels avian/scripts/mybirds.txt --sleep 6
# …or straight from the station instead of a CSV:
# .venv/bin/python avian/scripts/pregen.py --from-birdnet http://homeassistant.local:8080 --sleep 6
```

**Cut** the cream ground to transparency. First run downloads a ~1 GB matting
model; on CPU it's ~6 s/image:

```bash
caffeinate -i .venv/bin/python avian/scripts/cutout.py   # drop `caffeinate -i` off macOS
```

> If your tool kills long-running commands, just run `cutout.py` again — it's
> idempotent (skips already-transparent files) and resumes where it stopped.

**Rebuild masks**, then bake them into the card:

```bash
.venv/bin/python avian/scripts/build_masks.py
node homeassistant/card/build.js     # writes dist/habird-card.js with new masks
```

---

## 4. Quality check (recommended)

```bash
.venv/bin/python avian/scripts/verify.py --labels avian/scripts/mybirds.txt
```

This re-shows each new illustration to Gemini Vision *without* telling it the
species and flags wrong-species drift, anatomy errors, and stray perches into
`verify-results.csv`. Also eyeball the new PNGs in `avian/assets/illustrations/`.

To redo a bad one, add a one-line diagnostic note to
`avian/scripts/species-notes.json` (it carries forward), then regenerate just it:

```bash
.venv/bin/python avian/scripts/pregen.py --species "Genus species|Common Name" --force
.venv/bin/python avian/scripts/cutout.py <slug> <slug>-2
.venv/bin/python avian/scripts/build_masks.py && node homeassistant/card/build.js
```

(Slug = scientific name lowercased with non-alphanumerics turned to `-`, e.g.
`Passer domesticus` → `passer-domesticus`.)

---

## 5. Get them into your card

**A. Contribute back (easiest — and it helps the next person).** Open a pull
request adding your new PNGs, the updated `homeassistant/www/masks.js`, and the
rebuilt `dist/habird-card.js`. Once merged and released, the official HACS card
and its CDN cover your birds automatically — nothing for you to host.

**B. Self-host (private / immediate).** New species only show in the collage if
their **masks are baked into the card you load** — so you must use *your*
rebuilt `dist/habird-card.js`, not the official one. Then either:
- push your changes to your fork and point the card's **Artwork base URL**
  (`image_base`) at it:
  `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<you>/HABirdDashboard@<branch>/avian/assets/`, or
- go fully offline: copy `avian/assets/` to `/config/www/habird-art/`, set
  `image_base: /local/habird-art/`, and add your rebuilt `dist/habird-card.js`
  as a dashboard resource.

(Standalone webpage install instead of the card? `homeassistant/install.sh`
copies `homeassistant/www/` — including the rebuilt `masks.js` — plus the
artwork into `/config/www/habird/`; no card build needed.)

---

## Gotchas (the ones that actually bite)

- **Gemini `429 ... limit: 0`** — the key is free-tier; image generation needs
  billing enabled on its Google Cloud project.
- **macOS `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`** — you didn't `export SSL_CERT_FILE=…`
  (Step 2). It affects both the Wikipedia reference fetch and the Gemini call.
- **`cutout.py` dies partway** — re-run it (idempotent). On macOS prefix with
  `caffeinate -i` so the machine sleeping mid-run can't interrupt it; if a tool
  times out long commands, cut in batches by passing slugs.
- **New species don't appear in the collage** — the card's silhouette masks are
  inlined in `dist/habird-card.js`; you must rebuild it (`node
  homeassistant/card/build.js`) *and* load that rebuilt file. New PNGs alone
  aren't enough.
- **Style looks off / inconsistent** — you skipped the style references (Step 2).

---

## Working on the card itself (contributors)

Not generating art — changing the card/page code? The source of truth is
`homeassistant/www/` (`apt.js`, `index.html`, `styles.css`); the HACS card is
built from it.

```bash
node homeassistant/card/build.js   # rebuild dist/habird-card.js from www/
npm test                           # jsdom test suite (run after edits)
```

`avian/scripts/README.md` documents the illustration pipeline internals
(prompt, references, per-species tuning). `CHANGELOG.md` tracks releases.
