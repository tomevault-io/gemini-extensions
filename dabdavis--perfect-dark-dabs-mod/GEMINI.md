# Perfect Dark port — simulant/mod fork

Fork of the [fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) port.
`port` tracks upstream; work happens on `dabs-mod`.

`git checkout port` returns to stock at any time.

## What is written down here

Each note in `CLAUDE-notes/` is a thing that was got wrong once. Read the note
for an area **before** touching it — none of them are inferable from the code,
and each one cost a detour. This file keeps only what every session needs; the
notes are read when their area comes up.

- **The Windows build, wine, the pd.ini format** — [windows-build.md](CLAUDE-notes/windows-build.md): mingw prefix, WinHTTP, and why `Mod.LoadTextures=1` on its own line does nothing
- **chrs, bodies, heads, simulants, memory pools, mpconfig** — [chrs-and-memory.md](CLAUDE-notes/chrs-and-memory.md): a chr's prop is read before its tick; the ~50KB head copy that empties the stage pool; one head modeldef cannot sit on two bodies; ROM-resident structures never grow
- **Saves, eeprom, where pd.ini lives, the migration** — [save-format.md](CLAUDE-notes/save-format.md)
- **Menu text, `textMeasure()`, reaching the widescreen pillars** — [text-rendering.md](CLAUDE-notes/text-rendering.md)
- **Adding stages** — [stage-numbers.md](CLAUDE-notes/stage-numbers.md): `STAGE_IS_LEVEL()` admits 0x5e-0xff as well as the 27 free below the title; four ids are taken outside the table; the MP save format holds 7 bits
- **The Stage Loader: every mod's maps as arenas beside the mod loaded** — mods.md, "The Stage Loader": maps-only mounts never overlay; the registrar rescans on a swap; the branch's fixes (allocation, pool checks, room sizing, textures by stage); the importer splits a rebuilt texture table (30) and writes the `maps` block (31) so a mod's arenas come from its own tables under its own names — a file name is Perfect Dark's slot, not the map (GE-X's `crad` is Aztec)
- **Screenshots, the recorder, ffmpeg, GL capture** — [recording.md](CLAUDE-notes/recording.md): the frame is presented before `videoEndFrame()`; NV12 on the GPU; encoder detection; why it must never wait for the encoder; running on the real GPU with no window (llvmpipe hides driver limits)
- **Ghost Trials networking** — [ghost-trials.md](CLAUDE-notes/ghost-trials.md): WinHTTP and libcurl, why not one of them, and what the worker thread may touch
- **Check for Updates** — [updater.md](CLAUDE-notes/updater.md): `update.txt`, the baked-in channel, the two-rename swap
- **Mod directories, Load Mods, modconfig, `modcodediff`, the ROM symbol file, the data segment and importing a mod's weapon definitions** — [mods.md](CLAUDE-notes/mods.md): only the first mod dir joins the file search; files swap live, segments cannot; the `datasegment` block, `moddata.c`, and "where this stands" for continuing the import work
- **Texture packs** — [texture-packs.md](CLAUDE-notes/texture-packs.md): where a pack goes (one of four directories is read by nothing); decoding off the render thread and the backlog; the kept store and why a decode must never be handed over (textures flicker to the original otherwise); an emulator pack's image is the tile, the renderer maps the padded row; the *other* stretch is the game's own - a tile sampled past its edge, which no image edit can fix and **Stretched Edges** (`Video.StretchedEdges`: Original/Mirror/Repeat) can; PNG is ours, JPEG is stb_image, and the two row orders; font glyphs (the image is the whole tile, the outline pass wants both images); F7–F10; and **Community Packs**, which installs a pack from its author's release page - what is in the binary is the pack and not the release, the row-order marker is written at install time because v0.09 of the PD Plus pack renamed the `ext_tex` folder that used to say so, and the cover art is drawn through a stand-in tile the way an XBLA mesh's texture is (and is *not* turned over)
- **The Xbox 360 XBLA release: its textures, and drawing its models** — [xbla.md](CLAUDE-notes/xbla.md): the player's copy goes in `xbla/` the way a mod goes in `mods/` — the archive, the package, or a folder holding either, two deep, packages preferred — and a `.7z` is unpacked once into `xbla/.unpacked/` by whichever of the conversion and the mesh loader wants it first (three seconds, 250MB, `xblaImportGetStfsPath()` blocks and `xblaImportIsAvailable()` does not); the STFS volume descriptor is one byte from a 257-block file table of garbage; LZX is a 17 bit window and a chunk is not a stream; Textures.raw is two 52-byte tables and the second is a D3DTexture, which is where the format and the tiling come from; pitch aligns to 32 texels linear and 128 block; record index *is* the texture number for the first NUM_TEXTURES and half of them still do not match stock because 4J redrew them; PackedSegFile slot *i* is file id *i+1* and its plain files are stored already inflated; the geometry is 596 files in 4J's own format, named by a mesh id in `modelnode`'s padding whose low 12 bits are a file id and so **one more than the slot** (reading it as the slot gives every model the mesh next door, which looks nearly right), drawn by `port/src/xblamesh.c` as a Perfect Dark display list — 1:1 in the model's own coordinates, 25 vertices to a batch, a list per group so the node carrying part p draws group p (and a piece the game toggles off stays off), all of them under the first part's matrix, and the node's own `G_MTX` copied or it lands nowhere; two menu checkboxes on the *Xbox 360 (XBLA)* page, meshes and textures separately, and a texture pack goes on underneath both and never has to come off (a mesh's records are past the numbered ones, so the two cannot collide); both switches are live - the textures one because it is read where a picture is handed to the renderer rather than where a list is built, the meshes one because every model is matched as it loads whether or not it is on (a list of loaded modeldefs to go back over instead **crashes**: one can be freed inside a stage and its memory reused), which costs nothing measurable and never unpacks an archive (the empty "no package ready" answer is remembered, or every model load re-decides it - 57 opens of the player's archive over one level load - while the unpacking call still ignores it - and the level the switch was flipped in keeps its stock models, which is the one case on the page where a checkbox does nothing visible and the one line under it that is ever shown says so); a model drops whatever was registered against its own address as it loads, because a modeldef is freed and reused inside a stage and the draw path's definition test cannot tell that from a live one, which leaves `lvReset()`'s drop as the backstop for models never loaded again; textured by `port/src/xblatex.c` from the release's own records 3741-5746, which no pack can ship, through a 32x32 stand-in tile whose *address* names the record (the trick `texpackLoadReplacement` plays) and whose size is what a Vtx's 10.5 s and t can hold; the picture's rows are **not** flipped (a pack proves the decode order is the game's own) but the mesh's **`v` is**, D3D counting rows from the end the game's `t` counts away from — and a mirrored atlas does not look upside down, it looks like art that is simply wrong (sleeves across a chest, a waistband round the hips); skinned by `Mod.XblaMeshPose`, which is on: palette entry *i* is matrix *i* of the model, the palette holds each bone's **inverse** bind with a translation in its last column (not a bone position), and the header's float at +0x18 is the mesh's scale times 100 — a tenth for nearly every skinned mesh; heads are `Chead*Z` models grafted onto the body at its `HEADSPOT`, so they reach the hook with the body's model and the head's modeldef and are let through by walking the parents to the root through a headspot, and Joanna's three restructured heads pair by vertex count instead of node for node; a head's **stock hair** is a toggled node of its own that the release leaves at id 0 while marking a toggled piece it keeps with `0xFFFF` (54 of those, every one a gun's or a console's, against 232 zeros of which 166 are a head's), so a zero under a toggle on a *grafted* node draws nothing; **a plain zero is the mesh's geometry, not the node's** — the id is written on one node of a model and the mesh named there is the whole model (`CcarringtonZ` is one named list of thirty, and its mesh is 4792 vertices over a fifteen-bone palette), so reading a zero as "keeps what it has" drew the N64 body inside every character and the stock sofa inside the Institute's, which is what "both models loaded together, intermingled" was; a zero now draws nothing (946 lists) unless it is a far LOD alternative (864) or a toggled piece (125: muzzle flashes, the six heads' glasses), and nothing is suppressed unless the mesh itself is named on a list the game draws beside them (`CheadgreyZ` names its only mesh on a toggled alternative), which is also why the node table is 16384 entries now; **a mod's model is left alone** — the release's package is keyed on the game's own file ids and a mod keeps the id while replacing the contents, so GE-X's file 447 was paired by size against `CbiotechZ`'s mesh, one list of twenty-five took the whole of it and the other twenty-four kept drawing through it, which is what "both models on screen at once and the hair floating above the head" is (`romdataFileIsStock()`, plus the pairing by size having to account for every list it did not take — only a far LOD alternative may be left over); `--xbla-mesh-verbose` answers "are two models on top of each other" directly now, one `OVERLAP` line per (model, slot, reason); the pose arena is **a list of chunks** rather than one block a side, because a block can only be grown between frames and the frame that first wanted more drew a head a body's height above its body (one chunk a side for eight simulants, six for eighty); and four faults that were in here — `Mod.XblaMeshes=1` in pd.ini with the release still in its `.7z` drew nothing for ever because a model load never unpacks and the checkbox that would have was already ticked, the node registry never reused a tombstone and filled up over a match, the pose arena stopped growing at the frame that wanted more than the cap, and three bounds were a word short on a slot that a mesh id names but is not a mesh
- **The Friends of Joanna collab tree, `../pd-fojo-monorepo-collab/`** — [fojo-collab.md](CLAUDE-notes/fojo-collab.md): what their mod loader does that ours does not, why the trees cannot merge, and what is worth borrowing
- **Measuring a crowded match, `--rng-seed`/`--fixed-step`/`--exit-frame`, where the frame goes** — [performance.md](CLAUDE-notes/performance.md): compare instructions per frame on a seeded fixed-step match; the renderer is 60% of the main thread and is built at -O2; why the decomp at -O2 played a different game (game-defined sinf/cosf, an uninitialised pad flag) and how a divergence is bisected; run to a level frame rather than a wall-clock span, and check a renderer change with a pixel diff; why Model LOD does nothing
- **The third person camera, and why melee, rockets and beams came out of it** — [third-person.md](CLAUDE-notes/third-person.md): the player's shot is fired from the camera and not the eye, so the crosshair is honest at any offset but everything that measures *from* the origin was two metres out; the two halves of the fix and the melee site that does not go through the shot path; the floor flags the camera trace needs; driving the camera from gdb
- **Weapon numbers, `flags2`, converting a `weaponnum` comparison** — [weapons.md](CLAUDE-notes/weapons.md): the four checks, and what is deliberately not converted; a launcher branch keyed on the number must test the function's type, or a mod's table crashes it
- **The Randomizer: a mission dealt again from its own pieces** — [randomizer.md](CLAUDE-notes/randomizer.md): the roll goes between `setupLoadFiles()`'s writable copy and `setupCreateProps()`'s walk; `chrGetPadRoom()` hands a pad number back as a room; the intro stream's commands are 8, 12, 16, 32 and 40 bytes and have no length function; rewriting the spawn pad does not move a mission that opens with a cutscene; a tagged object survives being picked up, which is what makes a generated collect objective finishable; each decision draws from its own stream so a change to one part cannot move the others, and the log's fold is how that is checked; Endless Mode keeps dealing objectives and scores rooms covered; the Carrington Institute is a level and must be excluded from anything that runs on one; Chicago (0x1d) is the test bed and Villa never reaches gameplay under `--boot-stage`
- **The Randomizer's run: a room at a time across every map** — [randomizer-run.md](CLAUDE-notes/randomizer-run.md): every door out of the landing room is a portal and a portal is a whole stage load (the co-operative Deep Sea chain is the pattern, and `mainChangeToStage()` takes effect at the *end* of the frame); a mission's opening cutscene held the first landing off for 45 seconds; the kit goes back through the spawn (inventory inside `playerStartNewLife()`, hands from `playerSpawnWeapons()`, health after `playerSpawn()`) and never from the tick, which left a hand drawing a model nothing had loaded; the door test is "not in `prop->rooms[]`", not "`rooms[0]` changed"; a death must not end the stage; no objective type fits one room, so the run owns the top bit of `g_StageFlags`; the room is sealed until that objective is done and the doorway is a wall from the inside, and what is sealed is the landing room **plus the rooms touching it** (`modRunBuildZone()`, one door deep, built at the landing and dropped back to the one room when it would swallow a whole small map) since a single room is sometimes a stairwell (a refused move must leave a collision behind it, or the push reads the last real one and a door damages the player through a wall that is not there), the barrier's test is the portal's own so the two cannot disagree, and a room sealed too long is dealt a clock; landings are waypoints in rooms that have a portal; guards are modalarm.c with the body overridden, and a body drawn from the whole game has to be spawned the way a setup spawns one (`bodyInitSpecialChr()`: the robot's fireslots, or the beam render dereferences them); `--random-run` and `--run-autohop N` drive it headlessly
- **A rule or colour a mod's code changes that is not a weapon's** — mods.md, "The tail": `game/modrules.h` holds it with the stock default, a modconfig block sets it through one setter in mod.c, both importers read it; the branch `lua-pipeline` is the Lua experiment of 2026-09-07, kept and not merged

**[DabDavisGitHub.md](DabDavisGitHub.md)** is the companion to this file: the
GitHub remote, how commits are written, how a push becomes a release, and how the
stable and dev channels reach a player. Read it before pushing or tagging —
`dabs-mod` is a public default branch and a push to it rebuilds what every
dev-channel player's Check for Updates points at. A push that changes only
`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE-notes/` or `DabDavisGitHub.md` does not build.

When a session gets something wrong that the code could not have told it, write
it down: a new note, or a section in the one for its area, and a line here.

## GE-X import: where to pick up (2026-09-05)

The console mod GE-X 6a is the reference case for the mod loader. Its assets,
data tables, missions, music, environments, star field, weather, shield
colours, hit sounds, co-op buddies, the weapon lists behind eighteen flags, two damage rules and the unlocks all import (`build/mods/GE-X_6a_01-19-25/`, importer version 23); what is left is the code
GE-X *rewrote*, which `modcodediff` lists and nothing follows yet. Read
[mods.md](CLAUDE-notes/mods.md) from "GE-X's solo missions in the port" to the
end before touching any of it, then:

1. **Regenerate the list** — the summary is the work queue, largest first:
   ```sh
   python3 tools/modcodediff --rom ../pd-upstream/pd.ntsc-final.z64 \
       --patch build/mods/GE-X_6a_01-19-25/GE-X_6a_01-19-25.xdelta --summary
   ```
   `constants` regions are tables to follow (most are done); `rewritten` ones
   need reading. Every rewritten function of 9 words or more is read, and
   the tail's unlocks family too; what remains of the tail is listed in
   mods.md ("The tail, and the unlocks": the menu palette, the run-speed
   cave, King of the Hill, GE-X's hats ...), and the weapon-number sites
   the port still tests literally (weapons.md: ~60 in bondgun.c, ~63 in
   propobj.c), each a `FLAG_SITES` row once converted. GE-X's own
   weapon-number regions are all read as of importer 27 (mods.md, the
   four "number sites" sections; the second says why a row also needs a
   `codeSyms[]` entry in modimport.c), and five of its tail as of 29
   (mods.md, "The tail": settings in `game/modrules.h`, and what is left).
   `--prepare-diff DIR` writes both binaries; `mips-linux-gnu-objdump -b binary
   -m mips:4300 -EB -D --adjust-vma=0x7f000000` reads them.
2. **Two ways to follow a change.** A renumbered compare is a
   `follow_immediate(s)` site (the `playerconst`/`bgstage` pattern, one table
   row in both importers). A rewritten function is run on the toy MIPS
   (`emulate()` in `tools/importmod`, `emuRunArgs()` in `port/src/modimport.c`,
   the weather is the worked example, the shield colour the one for a
   function that tests its caller, the hit sounds the one for a list of
   weapon numbers: seed the tables, run per number, read what it stored)
   and written out as the port's own config. A weapon-number test in the
   port becomes a flag (weapons.md) and the importer writes `weaponflags`;
   arguments to a call are followed by call and register
   (`follow_call_args()`, the co-op buddies), since one function can hold
   four number spaces; a weapon test that became a list is read as a
   compare chain (`follow_compare_chain()`, `FLAG_SITES`), and a flag is
   written only when every site of it agrees. Across the archive the most rewritten functions are
   `player_tick` (38 mods, 27 of them a no-op word - see mods.md), then a
   block of 23 that every "all solos in multi" patch shares (`tex_init`,
   `setup_create_props`, `mp_start_match`, the unlock handlers);
   `modcodediff --summary` over every patch takes four minutes with `xargs
   -P 8` and is how to know whether a function is one mod's or the
   archive's. Whatever is added goes in **both importers**, `IMPORT.txt`
   lines identical, and bumps `MODIMPORT_VERSION` so old imports redo
   themselves.
3. **Test headlessly** on Runway (0x22) or later — Dam (0x30) and Facility
   (0x33) are unfinished in the patch and prove nothing:
   ```sh
   cd build && timeout -k 5 60 xvfb-run -a ./pd.x86_64 --moddir mods/GE-X_6a_01-19-25 \
       --savedir /tmp/pdsave --skip-intro --no-sound --boot-stage 0x22 --log
   ```
   Exit 124 is "ran until stopped"; 137 is a crash or hang, read the log.
   `--moddata-trace`, `--chr-trace`, `--setup-trace` and the
   `weather:`/`music:` log lines say what applied. `--boot-stage` takes the
   stage id, not the menu slot: GE-X's `g_SoloStages` remaps six missions.
4. **Open tester reports**: no guards on Dam (GE-X spawns them by AI as the
   player advances; a headless run cannot exercise it — a person must). Check
   the tester's binary commit before debugging a report from
   `sdg@10.8.0.3:~/pd-test/` (`strings pd.x86_64-linux | grep -m1 -E
   '^[0-9a-f]{7}$'`).
5. **Known gaps, deliberate**: stages a mod took weather away from keep the
   port's stock weather entry (inert without a rain/snow script command); the
   two importers order the `playerconst`/`bgstage`/`roomstage`/`buddyconst`
   lines differently (content identical); mod-only stage ids (GE-X's 0x4d–0x50)
   are skipped by `stage {}` blocks with a warning.

## Build and run

```sh
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .     # only after adding/removing source files
cmake --build build -j8
./build/pd.x86_64                      # needs build/data/pd.ntsc-final.z64
./build/pd-modded.sh                   # with the All in One mod
```

Release builds use `-Og` for the decomp except the hot files (`PD_HOT_O2`) — see the comment in `CMakeLists.txt` and [performance.md](CLAUDE-notes/performance.md). Warnings
about uninitialised locals in `collision.c`, `model.c`, `menu.c` and `mplayer/setup.c`
are pre-existing decomp artifacts; check `git diff` before assuming one is yours.

`build/` is gitignored, including the mod directories and `pd-modded.sh`. Keep the
mod zip: a clean rebuild takes them with it.

The Windows cross-build is in [CLAUDE-notes/windows-build.md](CLAUDE-notes/windows-build.md).

## This is a decompilation

Much of `src/` is decompiled N64 code. Two consequences that matter:

**Structs with offset comments** (`/*0x1be7*/`) document the original ROM layout.
Growing them breaks matching builds. Ours sets `MATCHING=0`, but treat it as a real
cost when considering upstreaming.

**Some code is unreachable by construction on N64** and becomes reachable the moment
a limit is raised. Every bug in this fork's history was of that shape: a fixed-size
table or an assumption nobody wrote down. `chrInit()` dereferenced NULL when the chr
pool was exhausted; `mpCreateBotFromProfile()` looped forever once chrs outnumbered
the 53 available heads; `langGetLangBankIndexFromStagenum()` had `default: while(true){}`.
When raising any cap, grep for fixed-size arrays indexed by the thing you are scaling.

## Debugging

Guessing from source failed repeatedly here; the stack was right every time.

```sh
# crash: symbolise the offsets the game prints
addr2line -f -C -e build/pd.x86_64 0x11abf5

# hang: main thread only, Mesa worker threads are noise
gdb -p $(pgrep -x pd.x86_64) -batch -ex "thread 1" -ex "bt 14"
```

**A Windows crash dialog** gives `PC` and `MAIN MODULE: [base]`, and a
backtrace of `[base]+offset` lines. The offset is from the image base, which
the release exe has at `0x140000000`, and the exe keeps its DWARF (30 MB for a
reason), so:

```sh
gh release download v3.1.2 -p pd.x86_64-windows.exe -O pd-v3.1.2.exe
x86_64-w64-mingw32-addr2line -f -C -i -e pd-v3.1.2.exe 0x1401ba7a3   # 0x140000000 + offset
```

Plain `addr2line` says `??` for every line. When the report does not say
which build, try each stable exe: the right one symbolises to a stack that
makes sense as a call chain, the wrong ones to functions that could never
have called each other. The reporter's data is not ours: a crash in a mod's
model that no stage here reproduces is a model their import has and ours does
not, and the question to ask them is which mission and what the first line of
their `mods/<mod>/IMPORT.txt` says.

stdout is block-buffered when redirected, so log lines sit unwritten. Flush a live
process before reading or killing it — `SIGKILL` discards the buffer:

```sh
gdb -p $(pgrep -x pd.x86_64) -batch -ex 'call (int)fflush(0)'
```

A hung process ignores `SIGTERM`, because the shutdown handler cannot run.

For "state disappears" bugs, instrument every mutating path rather than reading code.
The simulant-clearing hunt was solved by logging that showed a count of zero at every
suspected site — nothing was being cleared; nothing had ever been created.
