# Dubai Missile Command

Canvas-based missile defense game built with React + Vite.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # starts dev server (usually http://localhost:5173)
npx vite build       # production build to dist/
```

When doing local verification, if you stop the dev server for testing or debugging, start it again before finishing and confirm the local URL.
After implementing a feature or bug fix, proactively check whether the dev server is already running. If it is not running and browser verification could matter, start `npm run dev` yourself and report the active local URL before finishing.

## Browser Smoke Tests

Use the maintained Playwright smoke suite for browser boot/input/shop-flow checks:

```bash
npx playwright test e2e/smoke.spec.ts
```

For the full browser E2E suite:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

These tests boot their own production preview server via `playwright.config.ts`, so they do not require `npm run dev` first.

## Running the Bot

The Playwright bot (`play-bot.ts`) auto-plays the game for testing.

```bash
# 1. Start the dev server first
npm run dev

# 2. Run the bot against the active local URL (opens a visible Chromium window)
GAME_URL=http://localhost:5173/dubai-missile-command/ npx tsx play-bot.ts
```

The bot reads game state via `window.__gameRef`, calculates leading shots, prioritizes threats, buys upgrades in the shop, and avoids hitting friendly F-15s.

## Headless Simulation

Run games headlessly for testing and bot tuning.

```bash
# Run a single headless game with determinism check
npx tsx src/headless/sim-runner.ts [seed]

# Record best game as a replay file
npx tsx src/headless/record.ts [--seed=N] [--tries=1000] [--out=replay.json]

# Play a replay in the browser (requires dev server running)
npx tsx play-replay.ts replay.json
```

### Bot training

Use the `/train-bot` skill to benchmark and tune the bot. It runs batch games via `src/headless/train.ts` and analyzes results to tune `src/headless/bot-config.json`.

### Key files

- `src/game-sim.ts` — extracted game loop (spawning, upgrades, auto-systems)
- `src/game-logic.ts` — constants, collision, injectable seeded RNG
- `src/replay.ts` — replay runner (action-log based deterministic replay)
- `src/headless/sim-runner.ts` — headless game runner
- `src/headless/bot-brain.ts` — parameterized bot targeting/firing logic
- `src/headless/bot-config.json` — tunable bot parameters
- `src/headless/train.ts` — batch training benchmark (multi-worker)
- `src/headless/game-worker.ts` — worker thread for parallel game execution

### Replay system

Replays record bot actions (fire coordinates + shop purchases at tick numbers) with a seeded RNG. Drop a `replay.json` onto the game canvas or use `window.__loadReplay(data)` in the console. During replay, the shop UI shows for 2 seconds between waves and a toast displays what the bot purchased.

## Architecture

Current runtime architecture is split across:

- `src/game-sim.ts` — simulation and gameplay state mutation
- `src/art-render.ts` — shared art primitives and prebaked sprite generation
- `src/pixi-render.ts` — Pixi frame composition and render-time asset caching
- `src/game.ts` — runtime controller that advances sim and calls renderers

Start with [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md) for the current documentation map.
Focused breakdowns:

- [`docs/render-split-analysis.md`](./docs/render-split-analysis.md)
- [`docs/runtime-controller.md`](./docs/runtime-controller.md)
- [`docs/game-state-contract.md`](./docs/game-state-contract.md)
- [`docs/spawn-commander-reference.md`](./docs/spawn-commander-reference.md)
- [`docs/upgrades-shop-progression.md`](./docs/upgrades-shop-progression.md)
- [`docs/replay-system.md`](./docs/replay-system.md)
- [`docs/headless-bot-workflow.md`](./docs/headless-bot-workflow.md)

### Key constants

- `CANVAS_W=900`, `CANVAS_H=1600`, `GROUND_Y=1530`
- `BURJ_X=460`, `BURJ_H=340`
- `LAUNCHERS` at x: 60, 560, 860

### Game state (`gameRef.current`)

- `missiles`, `drones`, `interceptors`, `explosions`, `particles`, `planes`
- `defenseSites[]` — physical upgrade structures enemies can destroy
- `launcherHP[3]` — each launcher starts with 1 HP (upgradable to 2 with Launcher Kit L2), destroyed = can't fire
- `upgrades{}` — wildHornets, roadrunner, flare, ironBeam, phalanx, patriot, burjRepair, launcherKit, emp
- `stats{}` — missileKills, droneKills, shotsFired (shown on game over)

### Targeting system (`pickTarget`)

- 30% chance enemies target the Burj directly, aiming at a random spot on the tower trunk (`getBurjBodyAimPoint`)
- Otherwise, targets defense sites and alive launchers; picks closest-to-missile-spawn 70% of the time, second-closest 30%
- Top-spawning missiles within 200px of their target are offset 300-500px for interceptable angles
- The Burj hit area covers the tower body only — the pedestal band at the base (bottom `BURJ_PEDESTAL_FRAC` of `BURJ_H`) is excluded, and ground impacts never damage the Burj

### Upgrade systems

| Upgrade           | What it does                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Wild Hornets      | FPV kamikaze drones that auto-track threats                                                                  |
| Roadrunner        | AI-guided vertical-launch interceptors                                                                       |
| Decoy Flares      | Burj launches IR decoys that lure missiles off course                                                        |
| Iron Beam         | Last-resort laser: holds charge, burns down threats about to hit the Burj; spare beams strafe nearby threats |
| Phalanx CIWS      | Rapid-fire autocannon turrets                                                                                |
| Patriot Battery   | Long-range SAM with massive blast radius                                                                     |
| Launcher Kit      | Tree of four nodes (see below)                                                                               |
| EMP Shockwave     | Once-per-wave AoE pulse from Burj; rank 2 adds launcher pulses + ammo refill                                 |
| F-15 Eagle Patrol | Once-per-wave fighter formation that sweeps the upper sky; rank 2 adds a return pass                         |
| Burj Repair Kit   | Consumable that restores 1 Burj HP                                                                           |

The `launcherKit` family expands into a four-node tree (see `UPGRADE_NODES` in `src/game-sim-upgrades.ts`):

- **Rapid Reload** (rank 1) — reload window is 30 ticks base, 15 ticks upgraded
- **Launcher Armor Kit** (rank 1) — +1 HP per launcher
- **High Velocity Interceptors** (rank 1) — +50% interceptor speed and acceleration
- **Double Magazine** (rank 2, requires any rank-1) — shared magazine increases from 2 shots per live launcher to 4

### Active upgrades (EMP / F-15)

EMP and F-15 are mutually exclusive — one active per run. Each grants a single cast per wave; readiness is restored at wave start, not via a recharge timer. Rank 2 adds a categorical effect (EMP: launcher-network pulses + ammo refill + faster ring expansion; F-15: a return pass + faster fire) rather than just bigger numbers.

### F-15 Eagles

Friendly fighter jets that fly across screen and shoot down threats. Only direct interceptor hits (not splash damage) can destroy F-15s, penalizing -500 points.

## iOS Build (Capacitor)

Capacitor is already configured. To build and open in Xcode:

```bash
npm run ios    # builds with CAPACITOR=1, syncs to ios/, opens Xcode
```

This runs three steps in sequence:

1. `npm run build:ios` — Vite production build with `CAPACITOR=1` env flag
2. `npm run cap:sync` — copies `dist/` into `ios/App/App/public` and updates plugins
3. `npm run cap:open` — opens the Xcode workspace

From Xcode, select a simulator or device and hit Run.

## Perf Benchmarking

Use the maintained perf harness for replay-driven renderer baselines.

1. Start the LAN dev server:

```bash
npm run dev:lan -- --port 5173 --strictPort
```

The iPhone perf workflow assumes port `5173`. If Vite silently drifts to `5174+`, the live-reload shell and bench helper can end up pointing at the wrong place.

2. Create `.env.local` from `.env.local.example` and fill in:

```bash
IPHONE_UDID=00000000-0000000000000000
BUNDLE_ID=com.phejet.dubaicmd
# optional pinned baseline root for compare output
PERF_BASELINE_DIR=perf-results/baselines/<buildId>
```

`scripts/bench.sh` auto-detects the Mac's LAN IP via `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (with `en1`/`en2`/`en3` fallback), so no `MAC_HOSTNAME` is needed by default. Override with `MAC_HOSTNAME=YourMacName.local` or a literal IP only if auto-detect picks the wrong interface or you need a stable hostname.

3. Install the iPhone build you want to measure:

```bash
npm run ios:dev      # Live Reload build pointed at http://<host>:5173 (opens Xcode; Run manually)
npm run ios:deploy   # static production build, builds + installs on device — this is the PR metric
npm run ios:install  # re-install only (skips vite build + cap sync); needs an existing dist/
```

`ios:deploy` runs `xcodebuild -destination "generic/platform=iOS" -allowProvisioningUpdates build` and then `xcrun devicectl device install app` against `IPHONE_UDID` from `.env.local`. This avoids the need to open Xcode or pick a destination by hand. The legacy `npm run ios:prod` (= `npm run ios`) still exists and opens Xcode for the manual Run path if needed.

If mDNS is blocked, run the sync/open step manually with an IP-based dev server URL:

```bash
CAP_DEV_SERVER=http://192.168.1.23:5173 npm run cap:sync && npm run cap:open
```

4. Run the iPhone harness from the Mac:

```bash
scripts/bench.sh perf-wave1
scripts/bench.sh perf-wave4-upgrades --warmup 1 --loop 3
scripts/bench.sh --list-devices
```

Current iPhone perf flow:

- `scripts/bench.sh` probes `http://<host>:5173/api/save-perf`.
- It posts the next benchmark request to `http://<host>:5173/api/perf-command`.
- It activates the installed app with `xcrun devicectl`.
- The live-reload iPhone shell polls `/api/perf-command`, starts the replay from whatever screen the app is already on, uploads to `/api/save-perf`, and leaves the perf summary visible on-screen after completion.
- The matching report is written under `perf-results/runs/<buildId>/...`, copied to `perf-results/latest/<replay>.json`, and compared against `PERF_BASELINE_DIR` when configured.

Important findings from the iPhone perf investigation:

- Warm `xcrun devicectl --payload-url ...` delivery was unreliable for reruns when the app was already open. Cold-start deep links work because `AppDelegate.swift` forwards the URL from `argv`, but repeat benchmark runs should now go through `/api/perf-command` instead of relying on warm deep-link delivery.
- The live-reload shell must be synced against the LAN server you actually intend to use. After JS/runtime changes, rebuild and resync before trusting device behavior:

```bash
npm run build:ios
npm run cap:sync
```

- A typo in the sink URL produces the classic red `NOT FOUND` banner. The valid save route is exactly `/api/save-perf`; `api/save-perfD` or any other variation will replay fine but never hit the save middleware.
- If the app never reaches the Mac during a run, `npm run dev:lan` will show no `[perf-save]` lines. That means the phone did not POST to `/api/save-perf`, regardless of what the on-device replay looked like.
- If `.local` name resolution is flaky on the network, use a literal LAN IP for `CAP_DEV_SERVER` and for any manual `perfSink` URLs.
- The Capacitor WebView origin is `capacitor://localhost`. Vite 8's default CORS middleware only whitelists `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`, so a preflight from the device returns 204 without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and the perf POST fails with `PERF ERROR LOAD FAILED` on the on-screen banner. Fix is `server.cors: { origin: true }` in `vite.config.ts` so the dev server reflects the request origin back. Removing it will silently break iPhone perf again.
- The two `xcodebuild` and `devicectl` commands use different UDID schemes. `xcodebuild` wants the Apple hardware ECID (e.g. `00008130-...`); `devicectl` uses its own UUID (the one in `.env.local`). The `ios:install` script sidesteps this by building for `generic/platform=iOS` and installing via `devicectl` against `IPHONE_UDID`.

5. Capture the desktop baseline separately with the browser smoke harness:

```bash
npm run perf:smoke -- perf-wave1 http://127.0.0.1:5173/
npm run perf:smoke -- perf-wave4-upgrades http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

When benchmark replays change because the sim changed, re-record the fixtures first, then recapture both desktop and iPhone baselines and commit the new median artifacts under `perf-results/baselines/<buildId>/`.
