# Shotoku

Shotoku is a local-first authorization layer for AI agents.

Before an agent performs an action — calling a paid API, using an MCP tool, executing code, sending an email, deploying infrastructure, or spending money — Shotoku evaluates the request, applies policy, and records the decision locally.

Built first with x402. Designed for any payment or action rail.

No custody ever.

## Product One-Liner

Shotoku lets developers require approvals, enforce limits, and record auditable decisions before AI agents act.

## Core Question

Every feature should serve one question:

> Should this agent be allowed to perform this action?

If a feature does not improve authorization, approvals, policy enforcement, explanations, or auditability, it probably does not belong in v1.

---

# Current Repo Structure

Use the current repo structure:

```txt
shotoku/
├── core/
│   └── src/
├── cli/
│   └── src/
├── docs/
├── package.json
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── tsconfig.base.json
```

Do not introduce `packages/core` or `packages/cli` unless explicitly asked. This repo currently uses `core/` and `cli/` directly.

## Packages

- `core/` — authorization, policy, ledger, types, and integrations.
- `cli/` — command-line interface and Ink TUI.
- `docs/` — API docs, decisions, positioning, non-goals, quickstarts.

---

# Brand and Positioning

## What Shotoku Is

Shotoku is:

- Local-first
- Developer-first
- Open-source
- Authorization-first
- Approval-oriented
- Audit-focused
- Simple enough for agent builders and “vibe coders” to understand

## What Shotoku Is Not

Shotoku is not:

- A wallet
- A payment processor
- A payment network
- A custody provider
- A banking product
- An enterprise procurement system
- An ERP
- A generic workflow engine
- A cloud-first compliance suite

## Important Positioning Rule

Do not position Shotoku as only an “agent spending” product.

Spending is the first wedge. Authorization for agent actions is the category.

Good:

```txt
Local-first authorization layer for AI agents.
```

Bad:

```txt
Payment layer for AI agents.
```

Good:

```txt
Built first with x402. Designed for any rail.
```

Bad:

```txt
x402 company.
```

# Technical Principles

## Hard Rules

1. Commit every day.
2. Ship something every Friday.
3. No features during launch polish unless critical.
4. Tests before features.
5. No vibe-coded mystery code.
6. Every line should be explainable.
7. TypeScript strict mode stays on.
8. Do not use `any`.
9. Prefer interfaces for object shapes.
10. Keep modules small and focused.
11. No custody logic.
12. No private key storage.
13. No cloud requirement in the core authorization path.

## Engineering Style

- TypeScript strict.
- Prefer pure functions in `core`.
- Avoid side effects except in clearly named I/O modules.
- Separate types from implementation.
- Keep public APIs small.
- Make error messages human-readable.
- Do not expose raw stack traces to CLI users.
- Use `readonly` fields for request/response models.
- Prefer explicit imports from Node built-ins, for example `node:crypto`.

---

# Core API Shape

The core API revolves around `authorize()`.

## Request

```ts
export interface AuthorizeRequest {
  readonly actor: string;
  readonly action: AgentAction;
  readonly resource: string;
  readonly rail?: ExecutionRail;
  readonly amount?: number;
  readonly context?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

## Response

```ts
export interface AuthorizeResponse {
  readonly approved: boolean;
  readonly status: AuthorizationStatus;
  readonly reasons: readonly ReasonItem[];
  readonly decisionId: string;
  readonly timestamp: string;
}
```

## Reason Item

```ts
export interface ReasonItem {
  readonly type:
    | "policy_match"
    | "budget_check"
    | "limit_check"
    | "blocked"
    | "escalated";

  readonly text: string;
}
```

## Status

```ts
export type AuthorizationStatus = "approved" | "denied" | "pending_approval";
```

## Execution Rail

```ts
export type ExecutionRail = "x402" | "mcp" | "api" | "code" | "custom";
```

## Agent Action

```ts
export type AgentAction =
  | "purchase"
  | "api_call"
  | "execute_code"
  | "send_email"
  | "mcp_tool"
  | "custom";
```

# Desired Core File Structure

Prefer this structure as the project grows:

```txt
core/src/
├── authorize.ts
├── types.ts
├── policy.ts
├── ledger.ts
├── explain.ts
├── errors.ts
└── index.ts
```

## Responsibilities

### `types.ts`

Only domain types and interfaces.

### `authorize.ts`

Public authorization entrypoint.

### `policy.ts`

Pure policy evaluation.

### `ledger.ts`

Local decision storage and audit log.

### `explain.ts`

Human-readable explanations.

### `errors.ts`

Typed internal errors and user-safe error formatting.

### `index.ts`

Public exports only.

Keep `index.ts` boring:

```ts
export * from "./authorize.js";
export * from "./types.js";
```

---

# CLI Principles

The CLI is the screenshot surface. It should look intentional.

## Voice

- Terse.
- Precise.
- No marketing words.
- Present tense.
- Every message should explain what happened and what to do next.

## Output Symbols

Use:

```txt
✓ APPROVED
✗ DENIED
◷ PENDING APPROVAL
```

## Approved Output

```txt
✓ APPROVED  dec_abc123
  • OpenAI is allowlisted
  • Daily budget remaining: $475
  • Transaction below $50 limit
  Recorded at 14:05:22
```

## Denied Output

```txt
✗ DENIED  dec_def456
  • anthropic.com is not allowlisted
  • Requires explicit approval
  → Run: shotoku approve dec_def456
```

## Pending Output

```txt
◷ PENDING APPROVAL  dec_ghi789
  • vendor-xyz.com is not on the allowlist
  • A human must approve this decision
  → Run: shotoku approve dec_ghi789
```

---

# Common Commands

Use pnpm.

## Install

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Typecheck

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

## Run CLI Dev

```bash
pnpm --filter shotoku-cli dev
```

## Run Core Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @shotoku/core test
```

## Run CLI Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter shotoku-cli test
```

---

# Commit Style

Use Conventional Commits.

Examples:

```txt
chore: scaffold pnpm monorepo
docs: authorization API design
feat: policy evaluation engine
feat: immutable decision ledger
feat: end-to-end authorization
feat: shotoku authorize command
fix: user-facing error messages
docs: quickstart and API reference
```

Do not use `feat:` for documentation-only changes.

---

# Development Roadmap

Keep the day-by-day structure, but do not treat specific dates as constraints. Each “day” is a work unit.

---

# BLOCK 1 — Foundations

## Goal

`authorize()` works end-to-end. A developer can clone the repo, run one command, and get a decision with reasons.

---

## Week 1 — Scaffold + API Design

### Day 1 — Monorepo Setup

Status: mostly complete.

Tasks:

- Confirm GitHub org is `shotoku-dev`.
- Confirm repo is `shotoku-dev/shotoku`.
- Confirm pnpm monorepo works.
- Confirm folder structure:

  - `core/`
  - `cli/`
  - `docs/`

- Confirm TypeScript strict mode across packages.
- Confirm root `tsconfig.json`.
- Confirm per-package `tsconfig.json`.
- Confirm `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Confirm README has the authorization-first positioning.
- Confirm CLI renders first Ink screen.

Expected commit:

```txt
chore: scaffold pnpm monorepo
```

---

### Day 2 — CI + Conventional Commits

Tasks:

- Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- CI should run:

  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm test`

- Add `.gitignore`.
- Ignore:

  - `node_modules`
  - `dist`
  - `*.db`
  - `.env`
  - `.DS_Store`

- Add ESLint.
- Add Prettier.
- Add commitlint and husky only if the setup stays simple.
- Do not overcomplicate repo automation.

Expected commit:

```txt
chore: CI pipeline and commit conventions
```

---

### Day 3 — Authorization Type Definitions

Tasks:

- Create or update `core/src/types.ts`.
- Define:

  - `AuthorizeRequest`
  - `AuthorizeResponse`
  - `ReasonItem`
  - `AuthorizationStatus`
  - `AgentAction`
  - `ExecutionRail`
  - `Policy`
  - `PolicyRule`
  - `LedgerEntry`
  - `LedgerSnapshot`
  - `EvaluationResult`

- Create `docs/api.md`.
- Document the API from the types.
- Keep examples short and copy-pasteable.

Expected commit:

```txt
docs: authorization API design
```

---

### Day 4 — Policy Engine, TDD

Write tests first.

Test file:

```txt
core/src/__tests__/policy.test.ts
```

Required tests:

- Known vendor, under limit → approved.
- Known vendor, over daily limit → denied with reason.
- Unknown vendor → pending approval with reason.
- No policy file → denied with reason.
- Wildcard rule matches unknown action → pending approval.

Implementation file:

```txt
core/src/policy.ts
```

Main function:

```ts
export function evaluatePolicy(
  request: AuthorizeRequest,
  policy: Policy,
  ledger: LedgerSnapshot,
): EvaluationResult;
```

Requirements:

- Pure function.
- No I/O.
- No filesystem.
- No SQLite.
- No network.
- Checks resource allowlist.
- Checks action.
- Checks per-action or per-transaction amount limit.
- Checks daily limit against ledger snapshot.
- Returns structured reasons.

Expected commit:

```txt
feat: policy evaluation engine
```

---

### Day 5 — Local Decision Ledger

Start simple. Prefer append-only JSONL first unless SQLite is explicitly required.

The ledger must be:

- Local.
- Append-only.
- Auditable.
- Easy to inspect.
- Easy to test.

Recommended first implementation:

```txt
data/decisions.jsonl
```

Each line is one decision record.

Tests:

- Insert decision → readable back.
- Append-only behavior.
- Snapshot returns correct daily total for actor and resource.
- Query by status works.
- Query by actor works.
- Query by time window works.

Optional later upgrade:

- SQLite.
- Hash-chain.

Do not block the first version on SQLite complexity.

Expected commit:

```txt
feat: local decision ledger
```

---

## Week 2 — Wire + CLI

### Day 6 — `authorize()` End-to-End

Implementation file:

```txt
core/src/authorize.ts
```

Function shape:

```ts
export async function authorize(
  request: AuthorizeRequest,
  options: {
    readonly policyPath: string;
    readonly ledgerPath: string;
  },
): Promise<AuthorizeResponse>;
```

Tasks:

- Load policy file.
- Get ledger snapshot.
- Call policy evaluator.
- Write decision to ledger.
- Return `AuthorizeResponse`.
- Add integration test with real policy file and real local ledger.
- Verify full round trip.

Expected commit:

```txt
feat: end-to-end authorization
```

---

### Day 7 — CLI Setup + `shotoku authorize`

CLI package:

```txt
cli/
```

Use `commander` or `yargs`.

Command:

```bash
shotoku authorize --actor <id> --action <action> --resource <resource> [--amount <n>]

# Launch Messaging

## Core Pitch

```txt
Shotoku is a local-first authorization layer for AI agents.

Agents can spend money, call APIs, execute code, and use tools autonomously. Shotoku gives developers a simple way to see, approve, deny, explain, and audit what agents do — running entirely on their machine.
```

## Show HN Title

```txt
Show HN: Shotoku – Local-first authorization layer for AI agents
```

## Short Social Post

```txt
Shipped Shotoku: a local-first authorization layer for AI agents.

Agents act. Shotoku checks first.

approve()
deny()
explain()
audit()

Runs on your machine. No cloud. No custody.
```

---

# Success Metrics

At launch, aim for:

- 50+ GitHub stars.
- 20+ npm installs.
- 10+ meaningful community replies.
- 5+ targeted developer conversations.
- 1+ person who actually tries it and tells you what breaks.

Real feedback matters more than vanity metrics.

---

# Final Rule

Build the smallest useful version of Shotoku.

Do not chase abstractions.

Do not build enterprise features.

Do not turn the product into a wallet.

Do not let x402 become the whole identity.

Build the local authorization layer first.
