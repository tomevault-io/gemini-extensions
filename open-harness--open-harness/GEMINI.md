## ⚠️ CRITICAL: VITEST ORPHANED PROCESSES - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**NEVER run `vitest` without the `run` subcommand. Orphaned vitest processes will accumulate and crash the system.**

Vitest defaults to **watch mode** when it detects a TTY. When an agent session ends or is interrupted, vitest keeps running in the background. Multiple agent runs = exponentially accumulating orphaned processes that consume all system resources.

**Correct commands:**
- `bun run test` → runs `vitest run` (single run, exits when done)
- `bun run test:watch` → runs `vitest` in watch mode (interactive use only)

**FORBIDDEN:**
- NEVER run bare `vitest` without `run` subcommand
- NEVER run `bun vitest` (use `bun run test` instead)

**If you see orphaned vitest processes, kill them:**
```bash
pkill -f vitest
```

**Why this happens:**
1. Agent runs `vitest` (not `vitest run`)
2. Vitest detects TTY → starts in watch mode
3. Agent finishes/interrupted → vitest keeps running
4. Vitest spawns worker processes (`forks` pool) → those orphan too
5. Multiple agent runs → system overload → computer shutdown

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: TYPESCRIPT BUILD ARTIFACTS - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**NEVER emit TypeScript build artifacts into source directories.**

The build system is:
- **tsdown** → outputs to `dist/` (for bundling/publishing)
- **tsc -b** → outputs to `build/` (for type checking with project references)

**FORBIDDEN:**
- NEVER run `tsc` without proper config that sets `outDir`
- NEVER emit `.js`, `.d.ts`, `.js.map`, `.d.ts.map` files into `src/` directories
- If you see these files in `src/`, DELETE THEM IMMEDIATELY

**Correct commands:**
- `bun run build` → runs `turbo run build` → tsdown to dist/
- `bun run typecheck` → runs `turbo run typecheck` → tsc -b to build/
- `bun run lint` → ESLint (no file emission)
- `bun run test` → Vitest run mode (runs once and exits, no file emission)

**The .gitignore blocks these patterns but files still pollute the working directory:**
```
packages/*/src/**/*.js
packages/*/src/**/*.d.ts
apps/*/src/**/*.js
apps/*/src/**/*.d.ts
```

**If you accidentally emit files to src/, clean with:**
```bash
find packages apps -path "*/src/*" -type f \( -name "*.js" -o -name "*.d.ts" -o -name "*.js.map" -o -name "*.d.ts.map" \) -delete
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: ANTHROPIC SDK TESTING - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**WE HAVE AN ANTHROPIC SUBSCRIPTION. NO API KEY IS NEEDED.**

The Anthropic SDK works automatically via subscription. DO NOT:
- Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable checks
- Create mock providers for testing
- Skip real SDK testing because "we don't have an API key"
- Suggest integration tests "require an API key"

**TESTING APPROACH - MANDATORY:**
1. **Record fixtures with REAL SDK**: Run provider against real Anthropic API
2. **Use ProviderRecorder**: We built this infrastructure specifically for recording/playback
3. **Tests use playback mode**: Replay recorded fixtures deterministically
4. **Never mock the SDK**: Real responses, recorded and replayed

**Why this matters:**
- We spent significant effort building ProviderRecorder for exactly this purpose
- Mock tests don't validate real SDK behavior
- The subscription handles auth automatically
- Adding API key checks BREAKS the subscription flow

**The infrastructure exists:**
- `ProviderRecorder` service records stream events
- `ProviderModeContext` switches between "live" and "playback"
- `runAgentWithStreaming` handles recording automatically in live mode

**When writing provider tests:**
1. First run: Use "live" mode → records to ProviderRecorder
2. Subsequent runs: Use "playback" mode → replays from recordings
3. Commit recorded fixtures to repo for CI

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO MOCKS TESTING PHILOSOPHY ⚠️

**NEVER use mocks or stubs that fake behavior. Every test must exercise real code paths.**

### Rules

- **No mock services**: Never create stubs that return `Effect.succeed([])` or `Effect.void`
- **No fabricated fixtures**: Test data must come from real recordings, not invented by agents
- **No in-memory fakes**: Use LibSQL `:memory:` (real SQLite with real migrations) instead of fake `Map<>`-based stubs
- **No dual code paths**: There should be ONE implementation, not "real" and "test" versions

### What to use instead

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| `EventStoreStub` | `EventStoreLive({ url: ":memory:" })` |
| `EventBusStub` | `EventBusLive` (PubSub is inherently in-memory) |
| `ProviderRecorderStub` | `ProviderRecorderLive({ url: ":memory:" })` |
| `StateSnapshotStoreStub` | `StateSnapshotStoreLive({ url: ":memory:" })` |
| Mock providers | `ProviderRecorder` playback of real recorded responses |
| Fabricated JSON fixtures | Record real API responses, commit to repo |

### Test layer setup

All tests use real implementations with ephemeral databases:

```typescript
const makeTestLayer = () =>
  Layer.mergeAll(
    EventStoreLive({ url: ":memory:" }),
    StateSnapshotStoreLive({ url: ":memory:" }),
    ProviderRecorderLive({ url: ":memory:" }),
    Layer.effect(EventBus, EventBusLive),
    Layer.succeed(ProviderModeContext, { mode: "playback" })
  )
```

### Pure functions are fine

Functions like `computeStateAt` that take arrays as input don't need services or databases. They're just functions operating on data — no mocks needed.

### Why this matters

- Stubs hide bugs (a stub that returns `[]` never tests error handling, migrations, or constraints)
- LibSQL `:memory:` is fast (no disk I/O) and exercises real SQL
- ProviderRecorder already exists for deterministic replay of real API responses
- If a test needs a mock, the architecture is wrong — fix the architecture

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: ZERO TECHNICAL DEBT - NO WORKAROUNDS, NO EXCEPTIONS ⚠️

**NEVER introduce technical debt. NEVER create workarounds. Fix problems at the source. ALWAYS.**

### The Absolute Rule

When you encounter a problem - a type mismatch, a function returning the wrong thing, a legacy pattern - you have two choices:

1. **Fix it properly** - Update the source, change all callers, do the full work
2. **Work around it** - Add a conversion, a shim, a "temporary" hack

**Option 2 is FORBIDDEN. There are no exceptions.**

### What This Means In Practice

- **Type mismatch?** Fix the type definition. Don't cast or convert at call sites.
- **Function returns wrong format?** Fix the function. Don't wrap it.
- **Legacy code in the way?** Delete it and update all callers. Don't deprecate.
- **Need backwards compatibility?** NO. Break it. Fix all dependents.
- **"Just for now" solution?** NO. There is no "for now." Do it right.
- **Gradual migration?** NO. Migrate everything at once.
- **Feature flag for old vs new?** NO. One path only.
- **Conversion layer between old and new?** NO. One format only.

### Why This Is Non-Negotiable

**There is no such thing as a temporary workaround.** Every shortcut becomes permanent. Every compatibility shim becomes load-bearing. Every "we'll clean this up later" becomes "this is how it works now."

The cost of doing it right is paid once. The cost of a workaround is paid forever.

### Examples of FORBIDDEN Patterns

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Inline conversion instead of fixing the source
const event: SerializedEvent = {
  ...legacyEvent,
  timestamp: legacyEvent.timestamp.getTime()  // NO! Fix the source!
}

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Wrapper function instead of fixing the original
const makeSerializedEvent = (e: LegacyEvent): SerializedEvent => ({ ... })

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Type assertion to paper over mismatch
const event = makeEvent(...) as unknown as SerializedEvent

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Dual code paths
if (useLegacyFormat) { ... } else { ... }

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Deprecation instead of deletion
/** @deprecated Use newThing instead */
export const oldThing = ...
```

### The Correct Response

When you see a problem:

1. Identify the SOURCE of the problem (the function, type, or module that's wrong)
2. Fix the source directly
3. Update ALL callers/dependents
4. Delete the old code entirely
5. Run tests, fix any failures

**If this seems like "too much work" - do it anyway. The alternative is worse.**

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: NO TYPE CASTING FOR DATA CONSTRUCTION ⚠️

**NEVER use `as SomeType` to construct data. This bypasses TypeScript's type checking.**

### The Problem

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN: "Trust me bro" - TypeScript won't catch errors
const event = { _tag: "TextDelta", text: "wrong field" } as AgentStreamEvent

// The above compiles but is INVALID - schema expects `delta`, not `text`
```

### The Solution

Use schema-validated factories or `satisfies`:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Schema.make() validates at construction
import { makeTextDelta } from "@open-scaffold/core"
const event = makeTextDelta("correct")

// ✅ CORRECT: satisfies checks at compile time (no runtime cost)
const event = { _tag: "TextDelta", delta: "correct" } satisfies AgentStreamEvent
```

### Exceptions

- **Error narrowing in catch blocks is acceptable**: `catch (e) { const err = e as MyError }` - TypeScript types caught errors as `unknown`, narrowing is standard practice

### Testing Validation Logic

When testing that factory functions throw on invalid input, **use validation functions that accept `unknown`**, not type casts:

```typescript
// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Type casting to bypass TypeScript
it("throws if provider is missing", () => {
  expect(() => agent({
    provider: undefined as unknown as AgentProvider,  // NO!
    ...
  })).toThrow()
})

// ✅ CORRECT: Use validation function that accepts unknown
it("throws if provider is missing", () => {
  expect(() => validateAgentDef({
    provider: undefined,  // Clean - no casting needed
    ...
  })).toThrow("Agent \"test\" requires 'provider' field")
})
```

**Available validation functions:**
- `validateWorkflowDef(input: unknown)` - from `Engine/workflow.ts`
- `validateAgentDef(input: unknown)` - from `Engine/agent.ts`

### Why This Matters

The schema validation we added at boundaries (Phase 6) will **silently drop** malformed data. Type casts hide bugs until runtime - or worse, until production.
