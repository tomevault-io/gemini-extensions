# CLAUDE.md — Ham.Live (Open-Source Edition)

Guidance for Claude Code and contributors working in this repo (`hamlive-oss`). This is the
**public, MIT-licensed, self-hostable** edition of Ham.Live — a browser-first app for running
amateur-radio **nets** (coordinated on-air meetups where stations check in, exchange signal reports,
and follow a net-control-moderated agenda), with live presence, net discovery/following, and
real-time chat. It's the open-source sibling of the hosted Ham.Live service, shared for the
community to run and carry forward.

## Project status

Released **as-is** for the community to self-host. No guaranteed support, SLAs, or maintenance;
issues and PRs are handled best-effort; **forks are encouraged**. MIT — provided without warranty.
See `README.md` ("Project status") and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # auto-creates .env, starts a local replica-set MongoDB, runs the app
```

- Open **http://localhost:3000**, enter any email. When email isn't configured, the **magic sign-in
  link is printed to the server console** (and shown on the page) — no paid accounts needed for a
  full local test drive.
- `npm run dev` (`scripts/dev.js`) starts MongoDB via **`mongodb-memory-server` as a single-node
  replica set** — required because the app uses change streams (see Subsystems). It's **in-memory
  and ephemeral** (data is lost on stop). For persistence, run `docker compose up -d` first.
- Other scripts: `npm start` (prod-style run), `npm run build` (tsc server + client), `npm run
  dev:watch` (tsc `-w` + nodemon), `npm run mongo:dev` (just the dev DB), `npm run gen-certs`
  (self-signed localhost HTTPS cert). Full, OS-specific setup is in **`INSTALL.md`**.

## Architecture & stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + EJS (server-rendered views) + MongoDB (Mongoose).
- **Frontend:** TypeScript ES modules, native Custom Elements + reactive stores, **no bundler or
  framework**; Bootstrap 5; font **Outfit**.
- **Real-time:** MongoDB **change streams → Server-Sent Events** (with a polling fallback).
- **Auth:** magic-link email + optional Google OAuth; signed HTTP-only cookie sessions.
- **Chat:** GetStream (optional).
- **Optional external services** — all degrade gracefully when their keys are absent: SendGrid
  (email), GetStream (chat), QRZ (callsign lookup), Azure Maps (reverse-geocoding).
- Brand colors (in `client/dist/public/css/main.css`): `--hl-primary #dc8335` (orange),
  `--hl-secondary #6eb8c0` (teal), `--hl-light #f0eede` (cream). `--hl-success #3cce3c` is a utility
  green, **not** the brand color.

## Repo layout & the JS→TS migration ⚠️

```
client/   src/ (TS + SASS) → dist/ (compiled, served as static assets under dist/public/)
server/   src/ (TS — only for migrated modules) ; dist/ (what RUNS: controllers, models, routes, lib, views, bin)
docs/     technical docs (incl. docs/email-templates/ — reference SendGrid templates)
scripts/  setup.js, dev.js, devMongo.js
.env.example   every config option, documented
```

The project is **partway through a JavaScript → TypeScript migration**: some `server` modules have
TypeScript sources under `server/src/`; the rest are **maintained directly as JavaScript under
`server/dist/`**. **Before editing a `server/dist/**/*.js`, check for a matching
`server/src/**/*.ts`** — edit the `.ts` if it exists (it compiles to `dist`), otherwise edit the
`.js`. **EJS views live only in `server/dist/views/`** (no `src` counterpart). Subpath imports:
`#@server/*` → `server/dist/*`, `#@client/*` → `client/dist/public/js/*`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Architectural direction — the `liveNet` pattern is THE standard ⭐ (mandatory for new work)

**This is the required architecture for the platform — not a suggestion, and not one option among
several.** Every new screen **MUST** follow it, and every screen still built the old way **MUST** be
ported to it whenever it is touched. The mandated destination is a **100% TypeScript, framework-free
MPA**.

> **`client/src/public/js/byView/liveNet/main.ts` is the reference implementation. Copy its shape for
> every new page. Do not invent a different structure, and do not introduce a front-end framework to
> "solve" what this pattern already solves.**

Ham.Live is a multi-page app: each screen is a server-rendered EJS view with a per-view TypeScript
entry point that hydrates it with reactive data + native Web Component widgets. Three layers, always:

1. **Typed endpoint → reactive store.** `lib/stores.ts` defines `ReactiveStore<T extends
   EndPointResponse>` (abstract); a concrete subclass per data domain (e.g. `LiveNetReactiveStore`,
   `FavoritesReactiveStore`) binds an `EndPointClient` and owns **all** data sync — a short-poll that
   **auto-upgrades to SSE** when the response carries an `ssePath`, hash-based change detection, an
   optimistic-update "in-flight window," and a subscriber pub/sub. **Widgets never fetch; the store
   does.**
2. **Native Web Component widgets.** `lib/widgets.ts` defines `HamLiveElement<T extends
   ReactiveStore>` (abstract), which **extends native `HTMLElement`** and implements
   `StoreSubscriber`. Widgets register as `hl-<tag>` custom elements (`customElements.define`), use a
   closed **shadow DOM** with a shared adopted stylesheet, and implement a fixed contract:
   `getTemplate()`, `didMyDataSegmentChange()`, `render()`, `onConnected()`, `onDisconnected()`. On a
   store update a widget re-renders **only its own changed data segment** — fine-grained reactivity,
   no vDOM, no framework.
3. **Per-view composition root.** `byView/<view>/main.ts` (exemplar: `byView/liveNet/main.ts`) is the
   *only* wiring: create `EndPointClient`(s) → instantiate the `ReactiveStore`(s) → call each
   widget's static `.init(store)` (wrapped in `initAndLogError` for isolation) → `store.init()`.

**Hard rules — do not violate on any new or modified screen:**
- ✅ New screen ⇒ a TS `byView/<view>/main.ts` + a `ReactiveStore` subclass per data source +
  `HamLiveElement` widgets, composed exactly the way `liveNet/main.ts` does it.
- 🚫 **No** front-end framework (React/Vue/etc.). **No** data fetching inside a widget — the store
  owns all I/O. **No** ad-hoc/inline DOM scripts or one-off jQuery-style glue. **No** new
  plain-JavaScript view code.
- 🔁 Touching legacy JS? **Port it to this pattern** — do not extend the old JS in place.
- 🎯 Destination: **100% TypeScript**, client and server (see "Repo layout & the JS→TS migration").

Reference (study before writing a new screen): **`client/src/public/js/byView/liveNet/main.ts` — copy
this**, plus `lib/stores.ts` (`ReactiveStore`) and `lib/widgets.ts` (`HamLiveElement`); background in
`docs/client-framework.md`, `docs/client-reactive-pattern.svg`, `docs/sse-architecture.md`.

## Configuration

- **Env-var driven** — `.env.example` documents everything; config is loaded by
  `server/dist/lib/configLib.js` from YAML + environment variables.
- **No secrets are committed to this repo — keep it that way.** Use relative paths in committed
  files (no machine-absolute paths).
- Every external integration is optional and degrades gracefully when unconfigured.

## Subsystems

- **Real-time:** `server/dist/lib/realtimeClients.js` opens a change stream on the
  `stationinteractions` collection and pushes per-net updates over SSE. ⚠️ **Change streams require
  a replica set** — a standalone `mongod` will not work, which is why the dev DB is a single-node
  replica set.
- **Email (SendGrid):** `server/dist/lib/userNotification.js`. Off by default (no API key → emails
  are logged, not sent). The post-net **"Net Close Report"** uses a **SendGrid dynamic template**:
  create your own and set **`SENDGRID_NET_CLOSE_TEMPLATE_ID`**; a reference template and how-to live
  in **`docs/email-templates/`**. Unset → that one email is skipped (everything else still works).
- **Chat:** `server/dist/lib/streamChat.js` (GetStream; optional).

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `docs:`, …); Prettier formatting (`.prettierrc.json`). See
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- ⚠️ Change streams need a replica set (above). The in-memory dev DB is **ephemeral** — use
  docker-compose for persistent data.
- ⚠️ While `tsc -w` / `npm run dev:watch` runs, generated `.d.ts` files may be re-emitted with
  members reordered. That's harmless **watcher noise — don't commit it.**
- README images use a theme-aware `<picture>` (light/dark variants) so they stay legible on both
  GitHub themes; keep that in mind for any new repo imagery.

## Docs & community

- Technical docs live in **`docs/`** (architecture, data model, SSE, chat, auth, security, runtime
  config, API reference, net-admin commands, and more). The running app also has a built-in **Guide**
  at `/views/guide`.
- Questions, ideas, and self-hosting help: **GitHub Discussions**. For who's already running it, see
  `README.md`.
