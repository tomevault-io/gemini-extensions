This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

`jc-rs` converts the output of ~236 command-line tools, file formats and strings
to JSON, as a single static binary. It is a Rust implementation of the schemas
defined by [jc](https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc) (Python), pinned as a git
submodule at `./jc` (v1.25.7).

**The product is a compatibility number anyone can check, not speed.**
That premise decides most design arguments:

- Never invent a schema. jc is the authority; where the two disagree, jc-rs has the bug.
- Never edit a fixture to make a test pass. `make check-fixtures` will catch it.
- Never exclude an awkward fixture from the count; report it in a category.
- Publish the number even when it is bad.

Current state: 934/934 = 100% (`tests/differential/REPORT.md`). The workspace
version lives in the root `Cargo.toml`; `./ci/release.sh X.Y.Z` bumps it and
every internal pin in one step.

## Commands

```bash
make build              # cargo build --release
make check              # lint + fixture sync + tests + differential; the universal gate
make lint               # cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo fmt --check
make test               # unit + integration tests, pinned to TZ=PST8PDT
make differential       # full jc corpus; rewrites tests/differential/{REPORT.md,report.json}
make bench              # criterion, -p jc-rs-bench
make wasm               # build + Node-test the npm package (needs wasm-pack)
make submodule deps-py  # one-time setup: pin the jc oracle + its optional Python deps
```

Narrower runs:

```bash
TZ=PST8PDT cargo test -p jc-rs-parsers disk::mdadm          # one module's tests
TZ=PST8PDT cargo test -p jc-rs --test integration           # CLI integration tests
python3 tests/differential/validate.py --parser mdadm -v    # differential for one parser
python3 tests/differential/validate.py --fail-under 100     # the CI floor
```

`TZ=PST8PDT` is mandatory and non-obvious: jc's fixtures carry `*_epoch` fields
computed in local time and jc's own `runtests.sh` pins that zone. A bare
`cargo test` produces a pile of meaningless timestamp failures, and a
differential run in another zone silently drops 146 pairs from the denominator.
The Makefile, the CI test job and the differential harness all set it;
hand-run cargo does not.

## The compatibility floor

`--fail-under 100` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is what stops the number
sliding. Raise the floor in the same commit that raises the number; never lower
it silently.

## Architecture

Five crates, dependency order `core → utils → parsers → jc-rs`:

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `jc-rs-core` | `Parser`/`StreamingParser`/`LineParser` traits, `ParseOutput`, `ParserInfo`, `ParseError`/`CjError`, and the registry |
| `jc-rs-utils` | shared helpers: `simple_table_parse`/`sparse_table_parse`, `convert_to_*`, `normalize_key`, `parse_timestamp`, `slice_lines` |
| `jc-rs-parsers` | every parser, grouped by domain (`disk/ format/ log/ misc/ network/ package/ proc/ security/ string/ system/`) |
| `jc-rs` | the CLI binary: `args`, `magic`, `meta`, `output`, `streaming` |
| `jc-rs-wasm` | `wasm-bindgen` wrapper: `parse`, `parseRaw`, `parsers`, `StreamSession` |
| `jc-rs-bench` | criterion benchmarks |

**Registration is link-time via `inventory`.** There is no central parser list:
each parser declares a `static INFO: ParserInfo`, a `static X_PARSER`, and an
`inventory::submit! { ParserEntry::new(&X_PARSER) }`. The CLI has
`extern crate jc_rs_parsers;` solely to force linking so those submissions run.
Lookup goes through `find_parser()` (accepts `name`, `kebab-case`, or
`--argument`) and `find_magic_parser()` (matches argv against `magic_commands`).

**Streaming state lives in a session object, not on the parser.** The registry holds
`&'static dyn Parser`, which cannot be downcast, so `Parser::as_streaming()`
hands back the sub-trait and `StreamingParser::session()` mints an owned
`LineParser` carrying the per-run state. A streaming parser's `Parser::parse()`
must be `parse_via_session(self, input, quiet)`. The batch path and the live
path have to be the same code, because the differential only exercises the
batch one.

`docs/api-contracts.md` is the authoritative spec for these interfaces: types,
error-variant semantics, naming conventions (`name` is snake_case, `argument` is
`--kebab-case`), the `_jc_meta` object shape, and exit codes (0 ok, 100 error).
Read it before adding to `jc-rs-core` or writing a parser.

Parser unit tests live in each parser file and `include_str!` fixtures straight
out of `tests/fixtures/`, e.g.
`include_str!("../../../../tests/fixtures/generic/swapon-all-v1.out")` compared
against the sibling `.json`.

## How the compatibility number is produced

`tests/differential/validate.py` walks every `.json` fixture in the pinned jc
submodule and applies one rule: **a fixture pair enters the denominator only when
jc itself reproduces that fixture exactly.** Everything else is reported by
category (`oracle_reject`, `unmapped`, `no_input`) and never dropped.

`tests/fixtures/` is a verbatim mirror of the submodule, enforced by
`make check-fixtures` and refreshed with `make sync-fixtures`. Fixtures that are
this project's own test data (no jc counterpart) are left alone; what must never
happen is a fixture jc ships being edited here to match our output. The imported
codebase's "100% (687/687)" claim came from exactly those two mechanisms: a
harness that dropped 39% of the corpus and 17 rewritten fixtures. Do not
reintroduce either.

Bumping the `jc` submodule is a deliberate act: re-run the differential, expect
the number to move, and update the CI floor.

## Known structural gaps

- **`-r/--raw` is implemented where the corpus proves it.** `Parser::parse_raw`
  defaults to forwarding to `parse`, which is correct wherever jc's `_process`
  is a no-op; seven parsers override it. A parser with conversions but no raw
  fixture is still unproven; if you add one, check `-r` too.
- **Key order.** Keys serialise alphabetically; jc preserves schema order. Values
  agree so the differential passes, but no two outputs ever `diff` clean. Fixing
  it needs `serde_json`'s `preserve_order` plus per-parser key sequences.
- **Lint debt.** The workspace manifest bulk-allows ~80 clippy lints plus
  `dead_code`, `unused_imports`, `unused_variables`, `unused_mut`. CI is already
  at `-D warnings`, so removing them in batches is self-verifying.
- **Streaming is only live under `-u`.** Without it both jc and jc-rs
  block-buffer stdout when piped; that is jc's behaviour, not an oversight.
  `crates/jc-rs/tests/streaming.rs` covers what the differential structurally
  cannot: its fixtures are arrays and its input ends immediately, so a parser
  that buffers to EOF scores identically to one that streams.
- **`ifconfig` pays 10 ms before it reads anything.** Every pattern a parser
  needs is now compiled once per process rather than once per call, which is
  worth 65× to 129× per parse for `ifconfig` and `iwconfig` — but a CLI parses
  once, so single-shot runs saw none of it. `ifconfig` holds 31 patterns and
  applies all 23 of the detail ones to every line, so nothing is skippable and
  a 3-line input costs exactly what a full dump does. Cutting it means
  detecting the platform from the interface line first and only then touching
  that family's patterns. Parsers whose patterns were rebuilt *per record*
  (`traceroute`, `ufw`, `ping`) did gain end-to-end: 2× to 4×.
  `jc_rs_utils::cached_regex` exists for the case a pattern arrives as an
  argument and cannot be a `static`.

`tests/differential/report.json` has every failing case with paths and diffs.

## Commits

Every commit is authored and committed by `Oleg Sotnikov <os@g1sw.com>`. Never
add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any other attribution line: this is a
single-owner repository and the contributor list has to say so.

## The website

`website/` is jc-rs.com: Next.js 16, statically rendered, deployed as a
container behind the nginx container on `webapps-kz`. `website/README.md` has
the deploy commands and the infrastructure table.

The thing to know from here: **nothing on the site is hand-written data**.
`website/src/data/*.json` is generated by `website/scripts/build-data.py` from
`jc-rs -a`, the `ParserInfo` literals, `tests/differential/report.json` and
`tests/fixtures/`. Run `make site` after a release, or the site keeps
advertising the previous version and the previous number.

The front page runs `jc-rs-wasm` in the browser, so the converter there is the
same parser set the binary ships. `make site-wasm` rebuilds it;
`website/public/wasm/` is a gitignored build artefact.

## Release and publishing

Cutting a release is a `v*` tag: it fires `release.yml` (five targets, musl
Linux, bash/zsh/fish completions, a deliberately opt-in `jc` alias, checksums,
`scratch` Docker image, Homebrew tap, npm) and `publish-crates.yml` (crates.io in
dependency order) in parallel. Pushing the tag publishes everything; nothing
waits for a click. Each publishing job names an environment, which buys two
things: the environment accepts deployments only from `v*` tags (a
`workflow_dispatch` from `master` is rejected before any step runs), and its
secrets are visible to that one job instead of every workflow in the repo.

Deliberately *not* configured: an approval gate. This is a single-owner
repository, so a required reviewer would only ask the person who just pushed the
tag to confirm that they pushed the tag. Tagging is the deliberate act; adding a
second one buys nothing and trains you to click through. Restore it with
`gh api -X PUT repos/OWNER/REPO/environments/NAME -f 'reviewers[][type]=User'`
if the repo ever gains a second person with push access.

Every job that needs a credential checks for it first and reports-and-skips
rather than failing, so a release completes with whatever is configured.
Re-running a release is safe everywhere: crates and npm versions already
published are skipped, and an unchanged formula exits before `git commit` can
fail on "nothing to commit".

**Package the workspace, never a crate at a time.** `cargo package -p X`
resolves X's siblings against *crates.io*, so it cannot verify a version that
is not on the index yet, which is every version between the bump and the
upload. `cargo package --workspace --exclude jc-rs-bench` packages the members
into a temporary local registry and verifies each against that, so it holds at
any version. (`jc-rs-bench` is excluded as the one unpublished member: its path
dependencies carry no version, and packaging refuses that.)

- crates.io **and npm** publish over **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**. There is no
  long-lived registry credential for either. If the workflow ever falls back to
  `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`, fix the trust config rather than adding the secret back.
- **Never give the npm job a token.** `actions/setup-node` writes
  `_authToken=${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` into `.npmrc` whenever `registry-url` is set,
  and npm treats even an *empty* token as an attempt to authenticate instead of
  falling through to OIDC. So `registry-url` is omitted (npmjs is the default
  registry anyway) and neither `NPM_TOKEN` nor `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` appears in the
  job. Every failure on this path surfaces as `ENEEDAUTH` or a 404 regardless of
  cause, so read that as "check the trusted publisher", not "add a token".
  It needs npm >= 11.5.1, hence node 24; node 22 still ships npm 10.9.x.
  Registered on 2026-08-06 at npmjs.com/package/jc-rs-wasm/access against
  organization `OlegSotnikov`, repository `jc-rs`, workflow `release.yml`,
  environment `npm`. All four have to match or the token exchange returns
  non-200 and npm falls back to token auth, which is what produced `ENEEDAUTH`
  on the two releases before it. jc-rs-wasm@0.2.0 was the first version this
  path published, with a `provenance/v1` attestation tying the tarball to the
  run that built it.
- The Docker Hub overview does not update. `peter-evans/dockerhub-description`
  reports success and changes nothing, because `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` is a push/pull
  PAT and editing repository metadata needs a wider scope. Give the `dockerhub`
  environment a PAT with write access, or edit the description by hand.
- Only one long-lived credential remains. `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` exists because
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot reach another repository, and it is the only long-lived
  secret in the release path.
- Secrets live in GitHub *environments*, never at repository level.
- Third-party actions are pinned to commit SHAs. Keep it that way; some of these
  jobs can publish under our name.
- `CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always` is set in these workflows; never match cargo output
  with an anchored pattern (crate names arrive wrapped in ANSI escapes). The
  re-run guard queries the crates.io API instead.
- The published binary is `jc-rs`, never `jc`, because installing `jc` would
  shadow the original in `PATH`. The crate name `cj` on crates.io belongs to an unrelated
  2022 package; never document or publish under it.
- `LICENSE` keeps two upstream copyright lines. They are the MIT condition for
  the imported parser code and jc's fixture corpus, so they stay.
