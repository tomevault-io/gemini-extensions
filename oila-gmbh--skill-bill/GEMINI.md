## Project Context

skill-bill is a governed platform for authoring, routing, validating, installing, and measuring AI-agent skills. It ships shared orchestration, validators, installers, scaffolding, telemetry, workflow state, and stable base shells for review, quality checks, feature work, feature verification, and PR descriptions.

Non-negotiable contracts:

- Authored governed skill source is `content.md`; generated `SKILL.md` wrappers are runtime/install output.
- Source skill directories under `skills/<skill>/` contain only `content.md` plus optional `native-agents/`.
- Platform behavior lives in manifest-declared platform packs under `platform-packs/<slug>/`.
- `orchestration/` is the shared source of truth for routing, review, delegation, telemetry, workflow, and shell contracts.
- Generated support pointer files, provider-specific native-agent outputs, and installed staging artifacts are not committed.
- Discovery, install, routing, validation, and desktop surfaces stay dynamic and manifest-driven.
- Missing manifests, wrong contract versions, missing content files, and missing required sections fail loudly with typed errors.

## Product Intent

`bill-feature-task` is the feature-task router: it accepts `mode:runtime` (default) or `mode:prose`, presents one confirmation gate, then delegates. `bill-feature-task-prose` runs the full phase loop in-session. `bill-feature-task-runtime` launches the foreground `skill-bill feature-task` driver with durable workflow state, telemetry, platform packs, add-ons, and native subagents.

Bundled skills and reference packs are defaults, not the framework boundary. Teams may delete, fork, or replace them while retaining governed source shape, generated-output boundaries, manifests, install staging, validators, dynamic discovery, and loud-fail behavior.

## Taxonomy

- `skills/`: canonical user-facing skill sources.
- `skills/<platform>/`: legacy/pre-shell platform overrides for families not yet moved to platform packs.
- `platform-packs/<platform>/addons/`: flat pack-owned add-ons applied after routing.
- `platform-packs/<platform>/`: user-owned pack roots for code review and quality-check behavior.
- `orchestration/contracts/`: runtime contract schemas.

Naming:

- Base skills: `bill-<capability>`
- Platform overrides: `bill-<platform>-<base-capability>`
- Platform review areas: `bill-<platform>-code-review-<area>`
- Approved areas: `architecture`, `performance`, `platform-correctness`, `security`, `testing`, `api-contracts`, `persistence`, `reliability`, `ui`, `ux-accessibility`

## Source And Generated Files

Read `docs/skill-source-generation.md` before changing skills, scaffolding, rendering, install staging, native-agent generation, or support pointer behavior.

Generated files forbidden in source:

- governed `SKILL.md` wrappers under `skills/` or platform-pack skill directories
- generated support pointers such as `shell-ceremony.md`, `telemetry-contract.md`, `stack-routing.md`, review/delegation pointers, and add-on pointers
- provider-specific `claude-agents/`, `codex-agents/`, `opencode-agents/`, and `junie-agents/` outputs

Native-agent source is provider-neutral and lives under `native-agents/agents.yaml` or `native-agents/<name>.md`. New and rendered sources include `contract_version`; the parser still accepts older sources for gradual fixture migration.

If a skill needs more authored guidance, add H2 sections to `content.md`. Do not add extra organization files such as `patterns.md`, `reference.md`, or `audit-rubrics.md` under `skills/<skill>/`.

Run `./install.sh` after changing source skills, renderer behavior, or support pointer generation so local agent installs use the new staging hash.

## Platform Packs

Platform packs are the extension surface. Any maintained pack in this repo is valid when it follows the governed contract. Routing and install flows read pack manifests rather than hard-coded platform lists.

The canonical shape for `platform-packs/<slug>/platform.yaml` is `orchestration/contracts/platform-pack-schema.yaml` (Draft 2020-12 YAML-authored JSON Schema). Field additions, type changes, constraints, and enums land there first. `ShellContentLoader.buildPack` rejects malformed manifests through `InvalidManifestSchemaError`.

The shell contract version is `1.1`. `SHELL_CONTRACT_VERSION` and the schema `contract_version.const` are pinned by `PlatformPackSchemaContractVersionTest`.

Cross-field rules JSON Schema cannot express live in Kotlin and are documented under `x-coherence-checks`, including slug parity, declared-area parity, pointer uniqueness, baseline composition, and governed add-on usage.

Per-repo customization:

- top-level custom fields are allowed in `platform-pack-schema.yaml`
- runtime-consumed top-level fields carry `x-runtime-anchored: true`
- `PlatformPackSchemaAnchoredBijectionTest` enforces schema-to-Kotlin parity
- non-anchored top-level fields flow into `PlatformManifest.customFields`
- nested objects remain strict with `additionalProperties: false`

Product versus extension surface:

- horizontal `bill-*` skills under `skills/bill-*/` are protected product surfaces
- `skills/kotlin/` and `skills/kmp/` pre-shells are protected on the HorizontalSkill axis because removing them alone would orphan their packs
- platform packs under `platform-packs/<slug>/` are user-removable extension surfaces, including shipped `kotlin` and `kmp`
- `.bill-shared` is protected on every axis
- maintainers may remove deprecated shipped surfaces only through the CLI `--allow-shipped` path in this repo

`kmp` quality-check routing currently falls back to `kotlin`. `bill-feature-verify` remains pre-shell.

## Runtime Contract Schemas

Every YAML under `orchestration/contracts/` is a runtime contract. New contract YAML follows this recipe:

1. Author Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema in YAML, mirroring `$schema`, `$id`, `title`, `description`, strict `additionalProperties` where applicable, `contract_version` const, and `x-coherence-checks`.
2. Add a Kotlin `<contract>_CONTRACT_VERSION` constant equal to the schema const.
3. Add a parity test using `PlatformPackSchemaContractVersionTest` as the pattern.
4. Add a typed `Invalid<Contract>SchemaError` extending `ShellContentContractException`.
5. Loud-fail at every parse seam.
6. Bundle the YAML onto the JVM classpath with a configuration-cache-friendly Gradle `Copy` task using `inputs.file` and an execution-time `doFirst {}` existence guard.

Runtime contract schemas are internal implementation details and stay out of the desktop user-facing tree.

Schema introductions and version bumps intentionally loud-fail legacy durable records. Operators recover by deleting or migrating affected workflow rows out of band. `WorkflowRecordMapping.toSnapshot` does not validate; the next `WorkflowEngine` read seam rejects drift through `InvalidWorkflowStateSchemaError`.

## Add-ons

Add-ons are pack-owned files, not standalone skills. Keep them flat in `platform-packs/<slug>/addons/`, use lowercase kebab-case names, and resolve them only after dominant-stack routing.

Declare add-on consumers in the owning pack manifest under `addon_usage`. Do not hand-author per-skill add-on selection tables in `content.md`; the renderer emits governed add-on usage from the manifest. Add-on changes need validator and routing-contract coverage.

## Internal Skills

A base or platform-pack skill declaring `internal-for: <parent-skill-name>` in `content.md` frontmatter installs as a `<skill-name>.md` sidecar inside the parent's installed directory instead of being listed; the parent invokes it by reading that sibling file in-session. Full contract and worked examples: `docs/skill-source-generation.md`.

## Skill Authoring

Use the scaffolder for new skills:

- `skill-bill new`
- `skill-bill new --payload <file>` for scripted automation

For normal authoring use CLI reads and writes:

- inspect: `skill-bill show <skill-name>` or `skill-bill explain [<skill-name>]`
- write: `skill-bill fill <skill-name> --body-file <file>` or `--section <heading>`
- edit interactively: `skill-bill edit <skill-name> --section <heading>`
- validate: `skill-bill validate --skill-name <skill-name>`
- render preview: `skill-bill render --skill-name <skill-name>`

`create-and-fill` is for one content-managed skill at a time. It is not for horizontal skills, pre-shell overrides, or platform-pack bootstrap flows.

Supported scaffold `kind` values:

- `horizontal`: canonical skill under `skills/`
- `platform-pack`: pack root plus baseline code-review, default quality-check, and optional approved specialists
- `platform-override-piloted`: skill in the selected pack; for `quality-check`, register `declared_quality_check_file`
- `platform-override-piloted` for pre-shell families: legacy `skills/<platform>/` location until piloted
- `code-review-area`: specialist in the selected pack and manifest area registration
- `add-on`: flat add-on file in the selected pack

For `platform-pack`, payloads use either `skeleton_mode=starter|full` or `specialist_areas=[...]`, not both. Pre-shell families are defined in the Kotlin scaffold/runtime contract. Keep payload schema and exception catalog aligned with `orchestration/shell-content-contract/SCAFFOLD_PAYLOAD.md`.

The scaffolder is atomic: validator, manifest-write, install, or generated-link failures roll the repo back byte-for-byte.

## Adding Platforms

For code review, create the pack root, add a conforming manifest and `content.md` files, register generated pointers through the manifest, update the README catalog, extend pack tests, and run validation.

For quality-check, register the manifest entry and ship the governed `content.md`. In the built-in set, `kmp` falls back to `kotlin`.

For feature-implement or feature-verify overrides, keep the historic `skills/<platform>/` layout until those families are piloted.

## Runtime Agent Behavior

Agent-specific runtime behavior is expressed through injectable strategies, not conditional branching inside the process runner.

`AgentRunProcessRequest` carries named strategy objects that the process runner calls without knowing which agent is active:

- `progressProbe` — how to read workflow DB token changes
- `declaredProgressProbe` — how to read declared progress events
- `activityProbe` — how to detect file-system activity
- `progressEmitter` — how to write lifecycle events
- `idlePolicy` — whether a confirmed-alive process heartbeat extends the idle window (`HEARTBEAT_EXTENDED`) or only DB token changes count (`DB_PROGRESS_ONLY`)
- `usePtyStdio` — whether to use a PTY pair instead of separate stdout/stderr streams

Each `AgentRunCommandBuilder` sets the right combination for its agent. `ProcessWaitLoop` calls the strategies without branching on agent identity. When a new agent needs different behavior, add a named strategy constant and set it in its command builder — do not add if/else inside the runner.

## Comments Policy

Comments — especially inline ones — are a code smell. They signal that the code itself failed to communicate its intent. Before writing any comment, first ask: can this be expressed better in code through clearer naming, smaller functions, or a refactor? Only add a comment when the *why* is genuinely non-obvious and cannot be encoded in the structure of the code itself (e.g. a non-obvious external constraint, a subtle invariant, or a workaround for a known bug). Never write comments that explain *what* the code does — well-named identifiers already do that.

## Quality Checks

Prefer routing through `bill-code-check`. If no platform checker exists, document the fallback explicitly.

Design bias:

- stable base commands
- platform depth behind routers
- explicit overrides
- validator-backed rules
- acceptance and rejection tests

## Validation Commands

```bash
skill-bill validate
(cd runtime-kotlin && ./gradlew check)
npx --yes agnix --strict .
scripts/validate_agent_configs
```
