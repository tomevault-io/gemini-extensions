# Agency Language

## Overview

Agency is a domain-specific language for defining AI agent workflows. It compiles Agency code to executable TypeScript that calls OpenAI's structured output API.

Please read the guide at docs/site/guide/ to get up to speed on the language.

NOTE! Most of the file paths you'll see in this CLAUDE.md are relative to the packages/agency-lang directory, as that is the main package and contains all the code for agency lang.

## Key Commands

```bash
make                    # build everything (ALWAYS use this when changing stdlib files)
pnpm test               # Run vitest in watch mode
pnpm test:run           # Run vitest once
pnpm run agency <file>  # Compile and run an .agency file
pnpm run agency test <file>  # Run a single Agency test
pnpm run agency test js <file>  # Run a single Agency js test
pnpm run compile <file> # Compile .agency to .ts
pnpm run ast <file>     # Parse .agency and print AST as JSON
pnpm run preprocess <file>     # Parse .agency, run preprocessor, and print the resulting AST as JSON
pnpm run fmt <file>     # Format .agency file using the AgencyGenerator
make fixtures           # Rebuild all integration test fixtures
pnpm run lint:structure # Run structural linter
```

## The full pipeline

`parse → SymbolTable.build → buildCompilationUnit → TypescriptPreprocessor → TypeScriptBuilder.build() → printTs()`

## Testing

See `docs/misc/TESTING.md` for the full testing guide.

Agency execution tests (`tests/agency/`) do NOT require LLM calls. They can test pure logic, interrupts, async calls, etc. without any LLM involvement. Use them for any runtime behavior test.

Agency-js tests (`tests/agency-js/`) are similar, but let you test how agency code interacts with js code.

Note that although agency and agency-js tests don't *require* LLM calls, they can support them if needed. Don't make any extra LLM calls because they are slow and expensive, but if you are writing a test and you *need* to make an LLM call, please feel free to make one.

IMPORTANT! When you run tests, save the output to a file so that if the tests fail, you don't need to rerun them to see what failed. The tests in this repo are very expensive and slow to rerun, so if you keep rerunning tests to see what failed, you're going to waste a lot of time. Just run the test and save the output in a file once so you can examine the output at your leisure.

Note: Do not run the agency test suite locally. It takes a long time to run. When you create a PR, CI will run those tests for you. In the meantime, you're welcome to run specific agency tests locally if they are relevant to your change, but don't run the full test suite.

## Documentation

Standard library reference documentation is generated from Agency source using `agency doc`. When adding or changing stdlib APIs, write module-level doc comments, function doc comments, and docstrings in the `.agency` source files instead of hand-editing generated `docs/site/stdlib/*.md` pages. Docstrings also become tool descriptions for LLM-callable functions, so keep them accurate and user-facing. See `docs/site/cli/doc.md` for the `agency doc` conventions.

## CRITICAL: Handlers are safety infrastructure
Handlers (`handle` blocks) are a crucial part of what makes Agency safe. They must NEVER be accidentally skipped or left unregistered. Any feature that affects execution flow (rewind, interrupts, checkpoints, state restoration) must ensure handlers are correctly registered and invoked. If there is any risk of a handler being skipped, treat it as a critical issue and flag it immediately. Handlers are registered on `__ctx.handlers` via `pushHandler()` in the generated code and are NOT serialized as part of checkpoint state — be aware of this when working on state restoration features.

## VERY IMPORTANT: Agency syntax rules
When writing Agency code (in plans, specs, tests, or examples), you MUST use the correct syntax. Verify against `docs/site/guide/basic-syntax.md` and existing test fixtures when unsure.

**Correct syntax:**
- Functions use `def`, curly braces, and optional `: ReturnType` after params: `def foo(x: number): string { ... }`
- Nodes use `node`, parentheses for params, and curly braces: `node main() { ... }`
- `if`, `while`, and `for` statements REQUIRE parentheses around the condition AND curly braces for the body: `if (x > 5) { ... }`
- Variables must be declared with `let` or `const` before use. Bare assignment (`x = 5`) is NOT allowed without a prior declaration.
- `for` loops use `in`: `for (item in items) { ... }`

**Common mistakes to NEVER make:**
- `function foo() -> ReturnType:` — WRONG. Use `def foo(): ReturnType { ... }`
- `node main -> end:` — WRONG. Use `node main() { ... }`
- `if condition:` / `if condition {` — WRONG. Use `if (condition) { ... }`
- `result = foo()` without `let`/`const` — WRONG unless already declared.
- Using Python-style colon+indentation for blocks — WRONG. Always use `{ ... }`

**When writing plans or specs:** Always verify Agency code snippets by checking docs/site/guide/basic-syntax.md and existing test fixtures (tests/agency/, tests/typescriptGenerator/). If unsure about syntax, run `pnpm run ast` on a test file to confirm it parses.

## General code Guidelines
- NEVER use dynamic imports
- Use objects instead of maps.
- Use arrays instead of sets.
- Use types instead of interfaces.
- NEVER force push or amend commits.

## Things that often confuse you
Tools and functions are the same thing in the agency. Functions are tools. So there is no point in treating tools and functions separately because they're the same thing.

Please note that you cannot write and run agency files in the `/tmp` directory or any directory outside of the current directory, because certain node modules are needed for the files to run and the `/tmp` directory does not have those node modules.

## Guidance on writing commit messages and PR descriptions
If you try to write commit messages with apostrophes right on the command line, you will get an error. I'm telling you this now because you do this every time. Same with PR descriptions. Instead you need to write the commit message or PR description in a file, and then pass that in to the git command.

## Creating worktrees
Always create work trees inside the agency-lang directory. Never create work trees directly in home directory.

## General writing tips
When talking to me, or writing documentation or comments, please follow these general writing tips: packages/agency-lang/docs/dev/general-writing-tips.md

Specifically, make sure you are writing readable prose, not using jargon, and explaining things with examples where possible.

## Anti-patterns
Make sure the code you write does not have any of these anti-patterns:

- `docs/dev/effect-propagation.md` — How a function's interrupt effects are computed: the shared walk in lib/analysis/effects.ts, the fixpoint at the end of SymbolTable.build, following re-exports, the `.invoke()` shape, why `_guard` is seeded rather than walked, and the four things the walk cannot see
- `docs/dev/trailing-comments.md` — How `agency fmt` keeps an end-of-line `//` comment where it was written: the two mechanisms (`BaseNode.trailingComment` vs `placement: "trailing"` list trivia) and which applies where, who owns the end of the line, why a reordering formatter path must call `remapListTrivia`, the `CommaListPolicy` table, and the three ways this silently regresses

- `docs/dev/statelog-clients.md` — The six sealed statelog CLI clients over the one `statelogRequest` transport core: family-owned failure mappers vs core-owned fetch/envelope mechanics, the classification precedence, the two deviants (`requireOk:false` for upload, `contentType:"always"` for serve), `readJsonBody`'s redirect/http:// diagnosis, and the test rule that mocks stub `text()` not `json()`
- `docs/dev/remote-secrets.md` — `agency remote secrets`: the write-only store, the two invariants (value never in argv, value never in output) and their three enforcement layers (`sanitizeDiagnostic`, per-verb client redaction, `presentSecretError`), the HTTP-200 failure taxonomy, `import`'s parseEnv/no-`loadEnv` rule and file-only confirmation, and Commander-owned exit codes
- `docs/dev/schedule-remote-backend.md` — `agency schedule --backend remote`: the server-authoritative contract (no registry entry), binding-based target resolution via `resolveProjectTarget`, the failure-inside-HTTP-200 envelope, deploy-if-missing and the `runDeploy` outcome gate, the PATCH-only-cadence edit limitation, and why remote-only flags fail loudly on other backends
- `docs/dev/eval-labeling.md` — The human-label store behind `agency eval label`: why it lives outside `runs/`, occurrence vs content identity, immutable checklist revisions, the per-question annotation fold, the sign-off commit protocol and its recovery boundaries, and why validation is strict where grading is tolerant
- `docs/dev/invocation-usage-accounting.md` — The serve cost seam's full cost/token breakdown: the authoritative-flat-total vs best-effort-attribution split, the valid-price and kind-specific-token rules, the one `recordUsageDelta` sink, untrusted IPC recovery that never drops money, the #809 rejected-promise boundary, and the `agency remote spend` schema/rendering
- `docs/dev/per-invocation-config.md` — Per-invocation config overrides + injectable trace id: the `InvocationOptions` request, the single `resolveInvocation()` policy owner, the positive v1 config allow-list (and the inert filesystem/code-loading/model fields), run-id precedence and the resume rule, `RouteResult.traceId` presence, and the agency-is-a-mechanism / host-owns-clamping-and-trust boundary
- `docs/dev/aws.md` — AWS stdlib support (`std::aws/s3`): the SigV4 signer (node:crypto only, no SDK), the functional core (uri/base64/credentials/endpoints/sigv4/client), the atomic `AwsRequestTarget` and one-encoding canonical-URI contract, the single `runS3Operation` declarative executor, the bounded region/partition policy + `ValidatedBucket` + final-hostname defense, `std::aws/s3` vs the `std::aws::s3::*` effect labels, interrupt+destructive writes, strict-base64 binary with the 10 MiB two-way cap, the statelog redaction with a custom marker + narrowed v1 guarantee, and presigned URLs (query-string SigV4, the one-encoding contract on the query, the non-inherited final-hostname check, bearer-URL redaction)
- `docs/dev/data-connectors.md` — Writing a `std::data` connector: the shared core (`connectorFetch`'s internal approve as a vote not a bypass, `connectorError`, `clampLimit`, `dateStrToEpochMs`), the 8-part anatomy modeled on `stdlib/data/social/bluesky.agency`, the conventions (epoch-ms times, union-typed enums, clamped limits, `idempotent` reads, payload carries what handlers judge), wire types validated with bang syntax at the finalize boundary (`shapeError` embeds Zod's mismatched paths so drift fails loudly), the fetchMocks testing template incl. the shape-drift test, the agency-js style (import test, the propagate-surfaces-the-fetch pattern, -live tiers), ergonomics rules (adapt-don't-mirror, tagged unions over sentinels), the two runtime gotchas, and how to update a connector (absorbed the old adding-connectors.md)
- `docs/dev/speech-via-smoltalk.md` — Cloud speech (STT `transcribe` / TTS `speak`) routed through the LLM client like `std::image`: the local `say` vs cloud `speak` rename and DISTINCT effects (`std::say` vs `std::synthesizeSpeech`), the `_speak` ABI freeze, the conservative #809 failure-accounting rule, atomic no-clobber TTS publication (`publishSpeechOutput`), audio-token collapse into `totalTokens`, the `transcription`/`speechSynthesis` leaf events, the `Attachment` vs `MessageAttachment` split for `audio()`/`attachToReply`, and cancellation (branch signal → smoltalk `abortSignal`; `SmoltalkClient` adapts smoltalk's resolved `failure("Request was aborted")` into a reject with the branch reason via `rejectIfAborted`, since the `LLMClient` contract rejects on abort)

Parsers use the **tarsec** parser combinator library. Parser files live in `lib/parsers/` with co-located `.test.ts` files. See Tarsec docs: https://egonschiele.github.io/tarsec/. Debug parser errors with `DEBUG=1 pnpm run ast foo.agency > foo.debuglog`.

Templates in `lib/templates/` are compiled via [typestache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typestache). Run `pnpm run templates` to recompile. Only modify `.mustache` files, not the generated `.ts` files.

The runtime (`lib/runtime/`) is the library that compiled Agency code imports at execution time. Push functionality here whenever possible — it's testable and type-safe, unlike generated code.
