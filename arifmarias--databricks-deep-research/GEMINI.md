# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- The project uses Python with Databricks-specific libraries (MLflow, LangChain, LangGraph)
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - `mlflow[databricks]==3.2.0`
  - `databricks-langchain==0.6.0`
  - `databricks-agents==1.4.0`
  - `langgraph==0.5.4`
  - `pydantic<2.12.0`
  - `nest-asyncio==1.6.0`
- No traditional build, test, or lint commands - this is a Databricks notebook-based project

### Databricks Notebook Structure

- **driver.py**: Main Databricks notebook with `# Databricks notebook source` magic commands
- **multiagent-genie.py**: Core Python module imported via `%run ./multiagent-genie`
- Notebook cells are separated by `# COMMAND ----------` markers
- Development workflow requires Databricks environment with cluster compute

### Environment Variables Required

- `DB_MODEL_SERVING_HOST_URL`: Databricks workspace URL for model serving
- `DATABRICKS_GENIE_PAT`: Personal Access Token for Genie space authentication
- Configure in Databricks secrets for production deployment

### Running the Agent

- Main entry point: `driver.py` (Databricks notebook format with `# Databricks notebook source` magic commands)
- Core agent implementation: `multiagent-genie.py` (Python module loaded via `%run ./multiagent-genie`)
- Configuration: `configs.yaml` (requires manual setup of Databricks resources)
- Test agent: Use sample questions in `driver.py` cells 141-143 for testing different complexity levels

### Development Workflow

1. Update `configs.yaml` with your Databricks resources (catalog, schema, workspace_url, etc.)
2. Create Genie space and obtain space ID from Databricks workspace
3. Set up Databricks PAT token in secrets (required for Genie space access)
4. Load data using `data/sec/ingest-sec-data.py` if needed
5. Run cells in `driver.py` sequentially to test, log, register, and deploy the agent
6. Use sample questions in cells 141-143 for testing different complexity levels

### Testing the Agent

- **Simple Questions**: Test with single metric queries (e.g., "What was AAPL's revenue in 2015?")
- **Complex Questions**: Test multi-company comparisons and trend analysis
- **Temporal Context Questions**: Test date-aware queries (e.g., "What is the current fiscal quarter performance?")
- **Sample Test Cases**: Use `sample_questions` array in `driver.py` cells 141-143
- **Response Testing**: Both `predict()` and `predict_stream()` methods available

## Architecture Overview

This is a **multi-agent system** built with LangGraph for financial data analysis using Databricks Genie:

### Core Components

1. **Supervisor Agent** (`supervisor_agent` function in multiagent-genie.py:100)
   - Routes queries between agents based on complexity
   - Uses structured output to determine routing strategy
   - Implements iteration limits (max 3 iterations)

2. **Genie Agent** (multiagent-genie.py:52)
   - Databricks GenieAgent for SQL-based financial data queries
   - Accesses SEC financial data (2003-2022) for AAPL, BAC, AXP
   - Primary data source for Income Statement and Balance Sheet metrics

3. **Parallel Executor Agent** (`research_planner_node` function in multiagent-genie.py:146)
   - Executes parallel queries for complex multi-step analysis using asyncio
   - Uses `asyncio.gather()` with `asyncio.to_thread()` for concurrent Genie queries
   - Preserves MLflow context during parallel execution (eliminates tracing warnings)
   - Synthesizes results from multiple data sources
   - Renamed from "Research Planner" to "Parallel Executor" for clarity

### Data Scope

- **Time Range**: SEC financial data from 2003-2022 (updated from original 2003-2017)
- **Companies**: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Bank of America Corp (BAC), American Express (AXP)
- **Data Types**: Income Statement and Balance Sheet metrics
- **Supported Metrics**: See `data/sec/genie_instruction.md` for full list of financial ratios and calculations

### Workflow Pattern

```text
User Query → Supervisor → [Parallel Executor OR Direct Genie] → Supervisor → Final Answer
```

### Key Technical Details

- **State Management**: Uses LangGraph's `AgentState` with typed state including research plans and results
- **MLflow Integration**: All agent calls are traced with `@mlflow.trace` decorators
- **Chat Interface**: Wrapped in `LangGraphChatAgent` class implementing MLflow's `ChatAgent` interface
- **Streaming Support**: Both `predict` and `predict_stream` methods available with status updates to prevent timeouts
- **Configuration**: Extensive YAML-based configuration for Databricks resources
- **Async Parallel Execution**: Uses asyncio with `asyncio.to_thread()` for concurrent Genie queries (max 3)
- **MLflow Context Preservation**: Eliminates "Failed to get Databricks request ID" warnings
- **Error Handling**: Individual query failures don't cancel other parallel queries (`return_exceptions=True`)
- **Authentication**: Uses Databricks PAT stored in secrets for Genie space access  
- **Temporal Context**: Automatic fiscal year/quarter awareness with real-time date injection into prompts
- **Event Loop Compatibility**: Uses `nest-asyncio` for Databricks environment compatibility

### Implementation Details

- **Graph Structure**: Entry point is `supervisor` → workers (`Genie`, `ParallelExecutor`) → `supervisor` → `final_answer`
- **State Schema**: `AgentState` includes messages, next_node, iteration_count, research_plan, and research_results
- **LLM Configuration**: Uses ChatDatabricks with configurable endpoint (default: `databricks-claude-3-7-sonnet`)
- **Structured Output**: Supervisor uses Pydantic models (`NextNode`, `ResearchPlanOutput`) for routing decisions
- **Message Handling**: Only final_answer node messages are returned to prevent intermediate output noise
- **UUID Generation**: All messages get unique IDs for proper MLflow tracing

### Configuration Requirements

Before running, update `configs.yaml` with:

- Databricks workspace details (catalog, schema, workspace_url)
- Genie space ID and SQL warehouse ID
- MLflow experiment name
- Authentication tokens (stored in Databricks secrets)
- LLM endpoint configuration

### Data Files

- `data/sec/balance_sheet.parquet` and `data/sec/income_statement.parquet`: SEC financial datasets (2003-2022)
- `data/sec/genie_instruction.md`: SQL query guidelines and supported financial metrics for SEC data
- `data/sec/ingest-sec-data.py`: SEC data ingestion script
- `data/sec/agent-bricks-config.yaml`: Additional agent configuration for deployment
- `data/cc/`: Credit card dataset (alternative dataset, less developed)

### Agent Decision Logic

The Supervisor Agent uses structured output with the following routing strategy:

1. **Simple Questions**: Route directly to Genie for single-metric queries
2. **Complex Analysis**: Route to ParallelExecutor for:
   - Multi-company comparisons
   - Multiple financial metrics
   - Year-over-year trend analysis
   - Complex financial ratios requiring multiple data points

**Iteration Limit**: Maximum 3 iterations to prevent infinite loops

### Supported Financial Metrics

The system supports comprehensive financial analysis including:

- **Liquidity**: Current Ratio, Quick Ratio
- **Solvency**: Debt-to-Equity, Interest Coverage
- **Profitability**: Gross Margin, Net Profit Margin, ROA, ROE
- **Efficiency**: Asset Turnover
- **Growth**: Revenue Growth YoY
- **Cash Flow**: Free Cash Flow

See `data/sec/genie_instruction.md` for complete SQL formulas and implementation details.

### Deployment Architecture

The system is designed for deployment as a Databricks model serving endpoint with:

- **Automatic Authentication Passthrough**: For Databricks resources (Genie spaces, SQL warehouses, UC tables)
- **Environment Variables**: Secrets-based configuration for PAT tokens
- **Resource Dependencies**: Declared upfront for automatic credential management
- **MLflow Model Serving**: Compatible with Databricks model serving infrastructure

### Code Structure and Key Functions

**multiagent-genie.py Functions:**

- `get_temporal_context()` (line 77): Returns current date, fiscal year, and fiscal quarter context
- `supervisor_agent()` (line 138): Main routing logic with temporal context injection and structured output
- `research_planner_node()` (line 146): Parallel query execution with ThreadPoolExecutor
- `agent_node()` (line 237): Generic wrapper for individual agents
- `final_answer()` (line 251): Formats final response using configured prompt
- `execute_genie_query()` (line 165): Individual Genie query execution with error handling

**LangGraphChatAgent Class:**

- `predict()` (line 300): Synchronous prediction with message filtering
- `predict_stream()` (line 339): Streaming prediction with status updates

### Financial Data Analysis Capabilities

The system is specifically designed for SEC financial data analysis with predefined formulas in `data/sec/genie_instruction.md`:

- **Data Coverage**: 2003-2022 SEC filings for AAPL, BAC, AXP only
- **Table Aliases**: `bs` (balance sheet), `is` (income statement), `cf` (cash flow)
- **Query Guidelines**: Fully qualified columns, explicit filtering, NULLIF for division safety
- **Supported Calculations**: 15+ financial ratios including liquidity, solvency, profitability, efficiency, and growth metrics

## Critical Development Notes

### Authentication Requirements

- **Genie Space Access**: Requires `DATABRICKS_GENIE_PAT` environment variable for Genie space authentication
- **Model Serving**: Configure PAT token in secrets for deployment (`{{secrets/scope/genie-pat}}`)
- **Permissions**: Ensure PAT has access to Genie space, SQL warehouse, and Unity Catalog tables

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Streaming Timeouts**: Use `predict_stream()` for long-running queries to prevent client timeouts
- **MLflow Context Warnings**: Fixed by asyncio implementation using `asyncio.to_thread()`
- **Event Loop Conflicts**: Resolved with `nest-asyncio` dependency for Databricks compatibility
- **Parallel Execution Issues**: Monitor asyncio performance via MLflow traces; individual failures don't cancel other queries
- **Routing Accuracy**: Use structured output validation to ensure proper agent selection
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Synchronize formulas between Genie space instructions and multi-agent prompts
- **Temporal Context**: Ensure relative time terms are converted to explicit dates in parallel subqueries
- **MLflow Trace Verbosity**: Disable `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` and use manual `@mlflow.trace` decorators for clean trace UI output

### MLflow Tracing Integration

- All agent interactions traced with manual `@mlflow.trace` decorators for clean output
- **MLflow Autolog Disabled**: `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` commented out to prevent verbose LangChain state capture
- Monitor supervisor routing decisions, Genie query performance, and parallel execution coordination
- Enhanced Genie tracing with explicit query parameters for better trace visibility
- Use traces to identify optimization opportunities and performance bottlenecks

### Structured Output Schema

- `NextNode`: Controls agent routing with Literal type constraints
- `ResearchPlan`: Defines parallel query structure and rationale
- `AgentState`: Manages conversation state across iterations (max 3)

## Temporal Context Integration (Recent Enhancement)

The system now includes automatic temporal context awareness that provides real-time fiscal calendar information to enhance financial analysis:

### Temporal Context Features

1. **Automatic Date Context**
   - Current date in ISO format (America/New_York timezone)
   - Automatically injected into supervisor agent system prompts
   - Enables date-aware financial queries and analysis

2. **Fiscal Year Awareness**
   - Fiscal year calculation following Sep 1 → Aug 31 calendar
   - Labeled by end year (e.g., FY2025 runs Sep 2024 → Aug 2025)
   - Supports fiscal year-based financial comparisons and "current fiscal year" queries

3. **Fiscal Quarter Context**  
   - Q1: Sep-Nov, Q2: Dec-Feb, Q3: Mar-May, Q4: Jun-Aug
   - Enables quarterly financial analysis and reporting
   - Supports quarter-over-quarter trend analysis and "current quarter" queries

### Implementation Architecture

**Function Location**: `get_temporal_context()` in multiagent-genie.py:77

```python
def get_temporal_context() -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Return current date, fiscal year, and fiscal quarter.
    
    Fiscal year runs Sep 1 -> Aug 31, labeled by end year.
    Quarters: Q1=Sep-Nov, Q2=Dec-Feb, Q3=Mar-May, Q4=Jun-Aug
    """
```

**Context Injection**: Automatically prepended to supervisor system prompts:

```text
- The current date is: {today_iso}
- The current fiscal year is: {fy}  
- The current fiscal quarter is: {fq}
```

### Key Benefits

- **Date-Aware Analysis**: Supports queries like "How does this quarter compare to last quarter?"
- **Fiscal Context**: Enables fiscal year-based financial reporting aligned with business standards
- **Temporal Trends**: Better context for year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter analysis
- **Real-Time Updates**: Context automatically reflects current date without manual configuration
- **Enhanced Routing**: Supervisor can make better decisions based on temporal context

### Usage Examples

With temporal context, the system can now handle queries like:

- "What is the current fiscal year performance for AAPL?"
- "Compare this quarter's results to the same quarter last year"
- "How has performance changed since the beginning of the fiscal year?"

## Prompt Optimization

The system includes comprehensive prompt optimization capabilities documented in `docs/optimization-guide.md`:

### Key Optimization Areas

- **Supervisor Agent System Prompt**: Controls routing logic and decision-making
- **Research Planning Prompt**: Determines when to use parallel query execution  
- **Final Answer Prompt**: Formats responses for simple vs. complex queries

### Configuration Location

All prompts are configured in `configs.yaml` under `agent_configs.supervisor_agent`:

- `system_prompt`: Main supervisor routing logic
- `research_prompt`: Parallel execution decision criteria
- `final_answer_prompt`: Response formatting guidelines

### Optimization Guidelines

- **Bias Toward Genie**: Default to direct Genie routing for simple queries to reduce latency
- **Clear Thresholds**: Define specific criteria for complex analysis (e.g., "3+ separate queries")
- **Data-Aware Examples**: Use examples matching your actual dataset scope
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use MLflow tracing to monitor routing decisions and response quality

See `docs/optimization-guide.md` for detailed prompt customization strategies and testing approaches.
