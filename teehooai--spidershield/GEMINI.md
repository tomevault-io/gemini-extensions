# SpiderShield -- MCP Server Security Linter

## Project Overview
SpiderShield is a static analysis tool for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers.
It scans tool descriptions, security patterns, architecture quality, and licensing.
Think "npm audit for MCP tools".

## Architecture
```
src/spidershield/
  cli.py              -- Click CLI entry point (thin orchestrator)
  commands/            -- CLI command modules (scan, rewrite, harden, eval, agent, dataset, guard, policy, audit)
  models.py            -- Pydantic V2 models (ScanReport, SecurityIssue, etc.)
  server.py            -- MCP server mode (scan_mcp_server tool)
  spiderrating.py      -- SpiderRating format conversion (metadata, grades)
  scanner/
    runner.py          -- Orchestrates 4-stage scan pipeline + metadata emission
    description_quality.py -- Tool description scoring (7 criteria)

  dataset/
    db.py              -- SQLite schema v5, migration, get_stats
    collector.py       -- Best-effort recording (scans, rewrites, PRs, agent, guard)
  agent/
    scanner.py         -- Agent config security audit
    skill_scanner.py   -- Skill malware/injection pattern matching (20 patterns)
    toxic_flow.py      -- Dangerous capability combination detection (keyword + AST)
    pinning.py         -- SHA-256 content pinning for rug-pull detection
    allowlist.py       -- Approved-only skills enforcement
    sarif.py           -- SARIF output for agent findings
    models.py          -- Finding, SkillFinding, ScanResult, AuditFramework
    issue_codes.py     -- TS-E/W/C/P code registry
  rewriter/
    runner.py          -- Template + LLM description rewriter
    cache.py           -- SHA-256 keyed LLM rewrite cache
    providers.py       -- Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini providers
  hardener/runner.py   -- Security fix suggestions
  evaluator/runner.py  -- Tool selection accuracy testing
```

## Hard Constraints (G0 -- never violate)

1. **No false sense of security**: Never give A rating to a server with undetected critical issues.
   If uncertain, score conservatively.
2. **No destructive modifications**: `rewrite` and `harden` must never break working code.
   Always preserve original semantics.
3. **Reproducible results**: Same input must produce identical scan output.
   No randomness, no network-dependent scoring.

## Evolution Mode Protocol

SpiderShield uses evidence-driven evolution (see docs/internal/001-audit-quality-evolution-2026-03-08.md).

### Per-Change Cycle
1. **Evidence first**: Before changing a scanner, document the false positive/negative that motivates the change
2. **Measure before/after**: Run `spidershield scan` on test-targets/ before and after changes
3. **Update observation doc**: Record what changed and why in docs/internal/

### Scanner Quality Rules
- Security scanner: Minimize false positives. A false positive erodes trust more than a missed issue.
- Description scorer: Score must correlate with actual LLM tool selection success.
- Architecture checker: Gradual scoring preferred over binary pass/fail.
- Overall score: SpiderRating formula `descriptions*0.35 + security_adjusted*0.35 + architecture*0.30`.
- Architecture bonus: `min(2.0, arch_score / 5.0)` folds into security_adjusted.
- Grade scale: F/D/C/B/A (thresholds: 3.0/5.0/7.0/9.0).
- Hard constraints: critical→F, no_tools→F, license_banned→D cap.

### Scoring Calibration
- A server with no quality signals in descriptions should score 0-2/10, not 3-4/10
- A server with all quality signals should score 8-10/10
- Security score 10.0 means zero issues found, not "secure" (we can't prove absence)

## PR Campaign Quality Gates (G1 -- must pass before submitting any PR)

Before submitting a PR to any external MCP repo, ALL 5 gates must pass:

1. **Real problem**: The original description has a concrete, demonstrable issue
   (ambiguous scope, missing side-effects, misleading trigger). Not "could be better".
2. **Narrower and more precise**: The rewrite must be semantically narrower or more
   specific than the original. Never broaden scope.
3. **Preserves command semantics**: The rewrite must not change what the tool actually does.
   `git fetch` fetches from git remotes, not URLs. `git add` stages files, not "appends".
4. **One-sentence justification**: If you cannot explain the change in one sentence,
   the change is not high-confidence enough for an automated PR.
5. **Tests must pass**: If the target repo has CI, the PR must not break it.
   Description-only changes should never break tests.

### PR Strategy by Repo Type

| Type | Stars | Action | Example |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| A: Small active | < 1k | Direct PR | HenkDz/postgresql-mcp-server |
| B: Large/strict | > 1k | Issue first, PR if invited | modelcontextprotocol/servers |
| C: Corporate | any | Issue only | playwright-mcp, github-mcp |

### PR Anti-Patterns (learned from rejected PRs)

- **Tautological triggers**: "Opens a file. Use when user wants to open a file." (rejected by ida-pro-mcp #277)
- **Semantic mismatches**: git "fetch" matched to URL "fetch", git "add" matched to "append" (flagged on git-mcp-server #42)
- **Template boilerplate**: Generic error guidance unrelated to the tool's domain
- **Too many changes**: Large PRs scare maintainers. Keep to 1-5 tool descriptions per PR.

## Development Standards

- Python 3.11+ with type hints on all new functions
- Use Pydantic V2 for data models
- Rich console for CLI output
- Tests in tests/ directory
- No unnecessary dependencies

## 🔴 Production Status — NEVER Infer from Local Files

**This rule applies to ALL Owen's projects. Violation = wrong diagnosis.**

When asked to check if a job/service/pipeline is running, healthy, or broken:

### ❌ NEVER do this
- Read local SQLite/MySQL file timestamps
- Read local log files and infer production state
- Read local tmp/cache/debug files
- Use `git log` timestamps to guess if production is active
- Use local scheduler config to assume production runs the same way
- Use Explore agents to scan local repo as production audit evidence

### ✅ ALWAYS do this instead
1. **Ask the user for a production health endpoint** (`/api/admin/...`, `/api/health`, etc.)
2. **Or ask the user to check** the hosting dashboard (Render / Railway / Cloudflare)
3. **Or query the production database** (Supabase / Railway MySQL) directly
4. **If none of the above is possible**, explicitly state: "I can only see local files. I cannot confirm production status. The following is a guess that may be completely wrong."

### Production environment mapping
| Project | Local | Production | How to check |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| fullhouse-sports | SQLite + dev server | Railway MySQL + Render | `/api/admin/pipeline/dashboard` |
| fullhouse-asset | Windows Task Scheduler | Render / APScheduler | Supabase `ic_nominations` table |
| teehoo-core-shell | No local runtime | Supabase Edge Functions + Render cron | Supabase `pipeline_runs` table |
| spiderrating | Local pipeline occasional | Railway API + Cloudflare Pages | Railway metrics + Supabase |
| teehoo-martech | Local scripts | TBD | TBD |

### Why this rule exists
2026-04-13 incident: Claude diagnosed fullhouse-sports as "possibly dead for 35 days" based on local SQLite mtime. Production was actually v3.9.1, 19 jobs running, 54 success/0 errors in 24h, 55 predictions generated. The diagnosis was 100% wrong and would have wasted hours fixing non-existent problems.
