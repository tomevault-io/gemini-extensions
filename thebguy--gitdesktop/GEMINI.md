# GitDesktop — agent guide

An AI-native, keyboard-first Git desktop client (Tauri 2 + React 19), with an Astro
marketing site in `site/`. This file is the standing brief for Claude/agents; the
full human conventions live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), product intent in
[PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md), and ongoing project state in `memory/` (auto-loaded).

## Keep docs in sync with features — every time, unprompted

**When you add or ship a user-facing feature, update its docs in the SAME change —
don't wait to be asked:**

1. **`README.md`** — add/extend the relevant bullet under *Highlights* and/or *Features*.
2. **Marketing site** — add the capability to `site/src/data/capabilities.ts`, the
   single source of truth for the catalog (set `ai: true` only for AI features;
   `highlight: true` to surface it on the home page). Then add or extend a
   `FeatureRow` in `site/src/pages/index.astro` when it warrants a section. That
   page has two synced views, **AI-native** and **Just Git** — put non-AI features
   in both, AI features in the AI view only. Then `cd site && pnpm build` to verify.
3. **In-app user guide** (`src/features/help/content.ts`) — when a change adds or
   meaningfully alters a user-facing surface, update the matching guide section (or add a
   new one for a whole new surface), and keep it accurate (verify claims against the
   code, not memory). Shortcuts are `{{kbd:action-id}}` / `{{key:…}}` tokens, **never
   literal keys** (they resolve per-platform and reflect rebindings); gate AI content with
   the `ai: true` section flag + `{{ai}}…{{/ai}}` inline markers so *Hide AI* hides it.
   (Conventions + gotchas: `memory/help-guide-content-conventions.md`.)
4. **Changelog fragment** — for any user-facing **app** change, add a
   `changelog.d/<added|changed|fixed>-<slug>.md` file whose body is the finished
   Keep a Changelog bullet (written for humans). The changelog ships in-app (release
   body + updater notes), so **site-only work gets no fragment** — steps 1–2 are its
   record. **Never edit `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` directly** — fragments
   are assembled there at release time, and one file per change keeps parallel
   branches conflict-free. Preview with `pnpm changelog:preview`; conventions live
   in `changelog.d/README.md`. CI keys on paths: the required `fragment` check
   fires on any `src/` or `src-tauri/` change; one that needs no fragment takes
   the `no-changelog` label or `skip-changelog` in the PR title.

When a change alters **existing** behavior, grep README / site / help for the old
wording (e.g. the feature's old phrase) rather than updating spots from memory — stale
copies of the same claim hide across all three surfaces.

If a feature is too minor for the README / site / guide, it's fine to add only the
capability line + changelog fragment — but make the call deliberately, don't skip silently.

**Screenshots:** marketing-site screenshots for the **Just Git** view must be
captured with the app's *Settings → General → Hide AI features* ON, so they match
the AI-hidden experience. (See `memory/site-just-git-screenshots.md`.)

## Blog-post copy — anti-AI-tell rules (`site/src/content/blog/`)

Article prose ships under the owner's byline; readers (and the owner) flag AI-sounding
copy on sight. Hard rules for post text, learned the expensive way on PR #132 — they
govern phrasing only; technical claims stay empirically probe-verified as ever. They
apply to **every** post, shipped ones included: when a rule tightens, sweep the
back-catalogue in the same change rather than grandfathering it.

- **No earnestness performance.** Never "honest", "genuinely", "truly" as sincerity
  markers ("Two honest caveats"), and no valuation tics ("worth knowing", "worth the
  whole article", "it's worth").
- **No takeaway scaffolds.** "The thing to take away is…", "here's the part that…",
  "the key insight…" — state the point, don't announce it.
- **Antithesis budget.** "X, not Y" / "isn't X — it's Y" is a density guide, not a
  ban: keep every instance where the contrast IS the technical point being made, and
  cut the rest — reflex-reaching for the scaffold is the tell, especially twice in
  adjacent paragraphs.
- **Em-dash budget.** ≈7 per 1k words of running prose — list-item glosses, tables,
  and code don't count toward the rate. No paired "— aside —" interrupters; recast
  with commas or parentheses.
- **Closers written fresh every post.** The "Or don't do any of this" heading is a
  series motif; the prose beats under it are not. Never reuse a prior post's scaffold
  ("I write a Git client, so…", "Same X, same Y, minus Z", "Either way, the thing to
  take away…").
- **Measured numbers trace to transcripts.** Any figure you *measured* must be
  visible in a code block the reader has already seen — drop or demonstrate, never
  assert. Documented facts (version numbers, release dates, config defaults) may be
  cited directly.
- **Wrap band.** Prose lines ~76 chars, 81 max; no orphaned short lines
  mid-paragraph, no one-word paragraph trailers. Bare URL / link-target lines are
  exempt — never break a URL to satisfy the band.
- **Voice constants** (house style for the series): cold second-person open and a
  one-line Git aphorism close for technical posts (new words each time). Spelling
  and personal voice follow the post's **byline author** — derive them from that
  author's own writing, never from patterns shared by previously generated posts
  (two generated texts agreeing is one drafting process sampled twice, not
  evidence of a house style).

Blog mechanics (not copy) — **scheduling**: a future `pubDate` keeps a post
out of production builds — it behaves like a draft (visible in DEV and Pages
previews) until the daily `site-scheduled-publish` cron (00:37 UTC nominal;
GitHub can delay runs, so precision is the day, not the hour) rebuilds the
site. Use a **bare date** — midnight UTC, still the prior evening in US time
zones. A time component doesn't schedule an hour: the post appears on the
first production build after its timestamp — the daily cron, or any earlier
push/release rebuild — so a timestamp past ~00:37 UTC waits for the next
daily run unless an unrelated rebuild lands sooner.

## Everyday commands

```sh
pnpm build      # typecheck (tsc) + bundle the frontend
pnpm lint       # Biome (format + lint) — run before committing
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml   # Rust unit tests
cd site && pnpm build   # build the marketing site
pnpm changelog:preview  # preview pending changelog.d/ fragments
```

## A few house rules (see CONTRIBUTING.md for the rest)

- **Conventional Commits** with a scope: `feat(github,issues): …`, `fix(diff): …`.
- **Comments state constraints, concisely** — the decision plus one sentence of why
  (≤3 lines typical). Write only what the code can't show: invariants, deliberate
  non-obvious choices, cross-module contracts, hard-won external-API/platform
  behavior. Never change-history or PR references (commit messages own the story),
  never narrate the next lines or argue the diff is correct. (Multi-constraint
  blocks may run ~6 lines; measured figures a later reader would have to re-measure
  may stay and cite their source — a PR or run reference is fine there.) Trim any
  comment you touch to this standard.
- **Don't edit `src/components/ui/`** — those are vendored shadcn/Base UI primitives;
  fix at the feature/call-site level.
- **Keyboard-first, WCAG AA** — wire arrow-key nav for any new selectable list in the
  same change; never convey meaning by color alone; keep destructive paths confirmed.
- **React best practices** — before writing or refactoring any React component or hook,
  load the `vercel-react-best-practices` skill and apply it as you write (it doesn't
  auto-load — pull it in yourself). Vercel's 70-rule playbook: waterfalls, bundle size,
  data fetching, re-renders, memoization.
- **macOS Edit menu** — the app builds its own menu bar in
  `src-tauri/src/app_menu.rs::build_menu`. Whatever you change there, keep all seven Edit
  `PredefinedMenuItem`s (undo, redo, separator, cut, copy, paste, select-all) or derive
  from `Menu::default()`, or macOS text editing breaks in every input.
- The site deploys to Cloudflare Pages at `gitdesktop.app` (`base: "/"`).

## Delegated implementation (orchestrator ⇄ subagents)

For multi-file implementation work, prefer the `/delegate` workflow
(`.claude/skills/delegate/SKILL.md`): the main conversation architects and
writes work-package specs; the `implementer` agent (Opus,
`.claude/agents/implementer.md`) executes them; the read-only `spec-reviewer`
agent verifies. **/delegate requires Fable as the main conversation model**
(the agents themselves are pinned to Opus regardless) — non-Fable sessions
work inline instead. Both agents preload the `gd-conventions` skill — the repo
playbook of hard rules and gotchas (`.claude/skills/gd-conventions/SKILL.md`).
Only `implementer` may write files in this repo — plus the orchestrator for
trivial ≤ ~3-line reviewer/live-confirmed fixes during a /delegate run (see
the skill's Phase 4); every other spawned agent is strictly read-only, and
**no agent ever commits or mutates git state — the user commits their own
work.** (This section addresses the main conversation:
if you are a dispatched subagent working a package, do your package — never
re-delegate or spawn further agents.)
