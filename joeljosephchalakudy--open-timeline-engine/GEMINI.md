# Open Timeline Engine — Executor Policy

## CRITICAL: Protected Files — DO NOT MODIFY
The following directories contain core TCE infrastructure. NEVER edit, revert, or modify files in these paths, even if you believe there is a bug:
- `shared/tce_shared/`
- `services/tce_api/`
- `services/tce_lite_api/`
- `services/tce_mcp/`
- `scripts/`
- `infra/`

If you find a bug in these paths, report it to the user instead of changing it, unless the user explicitly asks to override this protection.

## Required tool-calling behavior

### Session management
1. Use one stable `session_id` per conversation and reuse it on every call.
2. Always pass `activation_mode_default="takeover"` on every `tce.takeover_step` call.
2a. On the first takeover call in a repository, pass `app_context={"project_root":"<absolute repo root>","project":"<repo name>"}`. Re-send it when the active repository changes; TCE binds it to the session for later calls.

### State resolution (history-driven)
3. Determine takeover state from conversation history ordering, not local flags:
   - If any activation phrase appears and no stand-down appears after it => active.
   - If a stand-down phrase appears after the last activation => inactive.
4. Do not rely on persistent local flags like `tce_takeover_active`.

### When to call takeover tools
5. On activation turn, call `tce.takeover_step`.
6. While active, call `tce.takeover_step` on every user message.
7. On stand-down turn, call `tce.reset_takeover_state(session_id)` and stop takeover calls afterward.
8. While inactive, do not call takeover tools in normal chat flow.

### Activation and stop phrases
- Activation: `beru take over`, `beru takeover`, `beru suggest`, `igris take over`, `kurama take over`, plus custom phrases.
- Stop: `beru stand down`, `shadow stand down`, `advisor stand down`, `kurama stand down`, plus custom stop phrases.

### Handling the result
9. If `persona_ack` exists, output exactly that text first; if `has_directive=true`, immediately continue directive execution in the same turn.
10. If `safety_decision=confirm_required`, show `final_response` and wait for confirmation.
11. If `has_directive=true`, immediately work on `state.takeover_context.objective` using tools. Do not narrate tool payloads.

### V6 directive lifecycle (mandatory)
12. If `execution_permit_required=true` and permit is missing, call `tce.request_execution_permit` immediately.
13. If execution claim is required (or `next_step` says to claim), call `tce.claim_execution` before mutating actions.
14. After execution:
    - Success: call `tce.report_execution(..., state="succeeded")`
    - Failure: call `tce.report_execution(..., state="failed", failure_reason="<reason>")`
    - For completed changes without a takeover directive, call `tce.complete_task` with title, files, decision, outcome/next step, git refs, and anchors before ending the turn.
15. If `retry_scheduled=true`, continue the same objective automatically unless safety requires pause.
16. If `autonomy_notice` is present, call `tce.ack_takeover_notice` unless already acknowledged.

### next_step precedence (critical)
17. If `next_step` contains actionable instructions (for example `AUTONOMOUS MODE PAUSED`, `Call tce.request_execution_permit`, `Call tce.claim_execution`), follow `next_step` first.
18. Natural response is allowed only when:
    - `has_directive=false`
    - `final_response` is null
    - `next_step` is empty or non-actionable
    - no execution lock is present (`pending_execution` absent and `directive_state` not `pending`/`in_progress`)
18a. If takeover is active and execution is locked (`pending_execution` exists or `directive_state` is `pending`/`in_progress`) but `has_directive=false` and `next_step` is empty:
    - call `tce.get_execution_status(session_id)`
    - call `tce.claim_execution(...)` for the latest pending directive
    - continue the same objective; do not emit natural handoff text (for example "If you want, I can do next...")

### Continuation until done or no longer relevant
19. While active, continue autonomously until one is true:
    - goal achieved/completed
    - explicit stand-down phrase
    - existing goal remains low relevance: `selected_goal.selection_score < 0.45` for 3 consecutive evaluation cycles
20. Empty goal queue handling:
    - if `selected_goal` is null or queue is empty, call `tce.takeover_discover_goals`.
    - if goals are discovered, continue with highest-priority goal.
    - if still empty, keep takeover active, ask a concise "what next?" prompt, and do NOT reset session.
21. Vague-response standby criteria while queue remains empty:
    - treat as vague when no actionable verb+target objective can be extracted (for example: "ok", "hmm", "sure", "continue")
    - treat as concrete when a specific task intent is present (for example: "fix dashboard takeover scroll")
    - if vague for 3 consecutive turns: keep session active, switch to suggest/standby, and do NOT call `tce.reset_takeover_state`
22. If `selection_score` is missing for an existing goal, remain active and re-evaluate next cycle.
23. On auto-stop (`done` or `low_relevance`), call `tce.reset_takeover_state(session_id)` and return a concise reason.
24. Suggest mode and takeover mode are both persistent while active.

### V7 bounded retrieval behavior (additive)
25. If takeover is active and `context_quality_score < 0.72` (or `retrieval_triggered=true`), allow one bounded retrieval expansion pass for that turn.
26. Keep retrieval budget bounded: total <= 120ms per turn and <= 60ms per backend/source.
27. If retrieval times out or falls back (`retrieval_source=lexical_only` or `retrieval_source=hybrid_fallback`), continue with fallback context and do not block the turn.
28. If post-retrieval quality is still low (`context_quality_score < 0.55`) or `needs_human=true`, pause autonomy and ask the user instead of guessing.
29. If quality is high (`context_quality_score >= 0.72`) with sufficient evidence, do not force deep retrieval.

### V7.2 workflow-memory hints (additive)
30. If `workflow_hints` is present in `tce.takeover_step` result, use the highest-reliability hint first.
31. Reuse hinted steps for the first execution attempt before inventing a new sequence.
32. If workflow hints conflict with `constraints`, permit/claim requirements, or safety decisions, constraints and safety win.
33. Workflow hints are guidance only; always finish with normal directive lifecycle reporting (`tce.report_execution`).

## Mandatory completion capture
1. Every completed mutating change must end with either `tce.report_execution` for a directive or `tce.complete_task` for ordinary work.
2. Use a stable idempotency key such as `git:<commit>` or `<session>:<task>:<result>`.
3. Do not claim completion when capture is queued or dead; report the delivery state and retry it.

## Conditional: check_context during active takeover only
Call `tce.check_context(file_path="<path>")` only when takeover/suggest mode is active and you are about to edit:
- `signal="block"` => do not edit, report to user.
- `signal="warn"` => inspect `past_decisions` and follow them.
- `signal="allow"` => proceed.

## Machine-readable constraints
`tce.takeover_step` may return a `constraints` array, for example:
```json
{
  "directive_type": "hard_constraint",
  "rule_id": "<unique-id>",
  "scope": { "path_prefixes": ["..."], "actions": ["edit"] },
  "enforcement": "block_and_escalate" | "pre_action_required",
  "reason": "<why>"
}
```

Rules:
1. Respect `hard_constraint` as non-optional.
2. If `block_and_escalate`, do not perform the scoped action.
3. If `pre_action_required`, perform required pre-action before proceeding.
4. Only override when user explicitly commands: `override constraint <rule_id>`.

## Non-negotiable
1. Active takeover must not silently degrade to normal chat.
2. If `has_directive=true` and safety allows, start tool actions immediately.
3. If `next_step` is actionable, do not ignore it.
4. Keep safety gates above autonomy continuation.
5. If `continuity_ok=false`, do not fall back to natural response; follow remediation in `next_step` and continue takeover flow.
