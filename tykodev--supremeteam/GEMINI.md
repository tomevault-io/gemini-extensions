# Supreme Team — Skill Manifest

> Authoritative index of all skills in this repository. Tools and agents use this
> file for skill discovery and routing. Paths are relative to the `skills/` directory.

> Installation note: keep the grouped `skills/` source tree intact and install it
> into your tool's configured skill path before invoking any skill. Recommended
> entrypoints are `scripts/install.ps1` on Windows and `scripts/install.sh` on
> macOS/Linux; see `Install.md` for the human and AI-agent installation
> procedure, options, manual fallback, and troubleshooting.

> Discovery prerequisite: assistants do not auto-discover skills from this
> repository checkout unless their configured skill path points here or you have
> copied the tree into `~/.agents/skills/` or `%USERPROFILE%\.agents\skills\`.

> Repository hygiene: `skillset-saves/` is generated Admiral runtime state and
> is intentionally ignored by Git. Do not stage or commit saved runs, locks, audit
> trails, or local scratch directories.

## Entry Routing

`admiral` is the **primary entry orchestrator** — the single front door for the
entire delivery lifecycle (design, build, review, ship, investigate,
checkpoint/resume, gate validation, skill/team creation). Every in-scope request
initiates through `admiral` so that one intake, one persisted run, and one
cross-stage gatekeeper govern the whole pipeline. The binding contract is in
`skills/routing-doctrine.md` and is reinforced deterministically by the
`harness/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py` hook. Standalone Tier-4 tools
(`safety-guardrails/*`, `browser-automation/*`, `release-and-deployment/*`,
`testing-and-qa/*`) run directly, outside this routing.

| Tier | Skills |
|------|--------|
| **Entry orchestrator** | `admiral` |
| **In-scope (must defer to admiral when reached cold)** | `design/commander`, `build/build-management`, `review/code-chief`, `skill-maker`, `investigate`, `session-memory`, `gatekeeper-admiral` |
| **Internal specialists** | every skill under `design/`, `build/`, `review/` not listed above |
| **Standalone tools** | `safety-guardrails/*`, `browser-automation/*`, `release-and-deployment/*`, `testing-and-qa/*` (plus the host `update-config` skill) |

## Admiral Layer (2 skills)

| Skill | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **admiral** | `skills/admiral/SKILL.md` | Primary entry orchestrator — single front door for the full design→build→review delivery lifecycle, plus investigation, resume, and skill/team creation |
| **gatekeeper-admiral** | `skills/gatekeeper-admiral/SKILL.md` | Cross-stage adversarial validator — validates handoff packages at every major delivery boundary |

## Design Sub-Pipeline (6 skills)

| Skill | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **commander** | `skills/design/commander/SKILL.md` | Design pipeline orchestrator — delegates to specialists, owns gatekeeper-design cycles |
| **researcher** | `skills/design/researcher/SKILL.md` | Requirements gathering and domain analysis — grounds the design in evidence |
| **planner** | `skills/design/planner/SKILL.md` | Delivery planning with milestones, rollout strategy, decision gates, and risk handling |
| **architect** | `skills/design/architect/SKILL.md` | System architecture (interfaces, API contracts, component boundaries, data flow) **and** owner of the frontend/UI visual design system (shadcn/ui tokens, component template, UI/UX spec, design review) for user-facing surfaces |

| **gatekeeper-design** | `skills/design/gatekeeper-design/SKILL.md` | Adversarial quality gate for design deliverables (design→build boundary) |

> The frontend/UI design system that previously lived in a separate `designer`
> skill is now owned by **architect** per `skills/design-doctrine.md`. There is
> no separate `designer` skill and no `tech-stacks/` template library.

## Runtime Harness (infrastructure, not skills)

Located at `skills/harness/`. Deterministic enforcement of the lifecycle layers
defined in `skills/harness-doctrine.md`. See `skills/harness/hooks/README.md` and
`skills/harness/gatekeeper/README.md`.

| Component | Path | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **pre_tool_use.py** | `skills/harness/hooks/pre_tool_use.py` | `PreToolUse` hook — blocks dangerous shell commands and writes into a frozen/guarded boundary (Layer 3 Action Realization) |
| **post_tool_use.py** | `skills/harness/hooks/post_tool_use.py` | `PostToolUse` hook — detects repeated failures, empty-output streaks, oscillation; injects a recovery hint (Layer 4 Trajectory Regulation) |
| **user_prompt_submit.py** | `skills/harness/hooks/user_prompt_submit.py` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook — advisory entry-routing reminder steering lifecycle requests through `admiral` |
| **verify_registration.py** | `skills/harness/hooks/verify_registration.py` | Diagnostic — confirms the three hooks are registered in host-native hook config (run by admiral at intake) |
| **check_readiness.py** | `skills/harness/hooks/check_readiness.py` | Diagnostic — reports Python version, hook registration, and active `skillset-saves` run status after Admiral startup |
| **\_gatecheck.py** | `skills/harness/gatekeeper/_gatecheck.py` | Shared stdlib gate engine behind every `gatekeeper-*` skill's `scripts/check.py` — deterministic, fail-loud package checks |

> Hook registration lives in host-native hook config and is installed only by
> explicit installer opt-in (`-RegisterHooks` / `--register-hooks`). Hooks are stdlib-only and fail open; the gate engine
> fails loud (a gate that cannot prove a package clean must never approve it).

## Doctrine & Protocol Files (skill set root)

| File | Path | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **routing-doctrine.md** | `skills/routing-doctrine.md` | Entry-routing contract: admiral as the front door, skill tiers, active-handoff loop guard, hook reinforcement |
| **grill-me-doctrine.md** | `skills/grill-me-doctrine.md` | Binding intake interview protocol run before any delegation |
| **design-doctrine.md** | `skills/design-doctrine.md` | Frontend/UI design-system doctrine (shadcn/ui token system) owned by architect |
| **harness-doctrine.md** | `skills/harness-doctrine.md` | Runtime harness doctrine — four lifecycle layers, failure taxonomy, engineering non-negotiables |
| **mcp-tools.md** | `skills/mcp-tools.md` | Global MCP tool registry; admiral enforces its `discovery_ttl_hours` freshness rule (default 480h) at intake |
| **save-protocol.md** | `skills/save-protocol.md` | Persistent save system specification — directory structure, file formats, write probe, mode re-check, session pin, resume protocol |

**Total: 47 skills** (Admiral 2 · Design 6 · Build 8 · Review 11 · Investigate 1 ·
Skill-Maker 3 · Session-Memory 1 · Browser-Automation 4 · Release-and-Deployment 4 ·
Safety-Guardrails 4 · Testing-and-QA 3), plus the runtime harness and six
doctrine/protocol files.

> **Note on folder depth:** `admiral`, `gatekeeper-admiral`, `investigate`,
> `skill-maker`, and `session-memory` sit directly under `skills/` (depth 2)
> because they are cross-cutting Admiral-pipeline components. Pipeline-stage
> skills nest under their category directory (`design/`, `build/`, `review/`),
> and standalone tools nest under their group directory. This manifest provides
> the authoritative flat index for tool discovery regardless of nesting depth.
