# Release Review Guidelines for AI Agents

Any software release (whether code, configuration, or documentation in this repository or any app utilizing this playbook) must be thoroughly audited against App Store and Google Play rejection rules.

You MUST perform this review as if the release were about to be submitted directly to the App Store and Google Play.

## Mandatory Verification Checklist

Before certifying a release as clear to submit/ship, verify every item below. Map each to its corresponding playbook file, checklist, or script to perform the check.

### 1. Permissions
* **Verify.** Ensure no sensitive permissions (e.g., location, storage, camera) are declared without a core user-facing feature or a specific, non-generic purpose string.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Privacy and data" & "Google Play specific"
  * Guard: `agent-os/hooks/app-store-compliance-guard.sh` (scans for standard purpose strings and sensitive permissions)
  * Rules Reference: `references/rules/privacy.md` & `references/rules/android.md`

### 2. Privacy Disclosures
* **Verify.** Ensure the app displays appropriate consent modals and nutrition/safety declarations for data collection or SDK tracking.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Privacy and data"
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `APPLE-5.1.2-MISSING-ATT` & `GOOGLE-DATASAFETY-MISMATCH`
  * Rules Reference: `references/rules/privacy.md`

### 3. Screenshots
* **Verify.** Check that screenshots in the store metadata show the app in actual use (not splash or login screens) and are accurate representation of the current features.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Metadata and listing"
  * Rules Reference: `references/rules/metadata.md`

### 4. Metadata
* **Verify.** Check character limits, emojis, ALL CAPS, curse words, other platform references, ranking claims, and future feature promises.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Script: `scripts/metadata-audit.py` (checks name, subtitle, description, keywords)
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `BOTH-METADATA-DECORATION` & `APPLE-2.3-CROSS-PLATFORM-REFERENCE`
  * Rules Reference: `references/rules/metadata.md`

### 5. Age Rating
* **Verify.** Ensure that the 2026 Apple age rating questions (13+, 16+, 18+) are fully answered and that any child-directed or mature content triggers appropriate gating.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Apple specific" (APPLE-2.3-AGE-RATING-2026)
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `APPLE-2.3-AGE-RATING-2026`
  * Global Rules: `docs/GLOBAL-REGULATORY-2026.md`

### 6. AI Disclosures
* **Verify.** Verify that any generative AI integration has a content moderation safeguard, appropriate age rating, and, for EU users, displays an in-app notice that the user is interacting with an AI (EU AI Act Article 50(1)). Confirm third-party AI consent modals are present.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "EU specific" & "Global specific"

### 7. Subscription Disclosures
* **Verify.** Subscription terms, auto-renewals, billing periods, pricing hierarchy, and Terms of Use (ToS/EULA) links must be clearly laid out inside the app and in the metadata description.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Monetization" & "Apple specific"
  * Script: `scripts/metadata-audit.py` (verifies terms/EULA links when subscriptions are mentioned)
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `APPLE-3.1.2-MISLEADING-PRICING`

### 8. Payment Compliance
* **Verify.** Confirm that Play Billing or StoreKit is utilized for in-app digital goods (with StoreKit Restore Purchases functionality present). Ensure third-party gateways (e.g. Stripe, PayPal) are restricted to physical goods or exempt categories.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Monetization" & "Platform mechanics gate"
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `APPLE-3.1.1-EXTERNAL-PAYMENT`, `GOOGLE-PLAY-BILLING`, & `APPLE-RESTORE-PURCHASES-MISSING`
  * Rules Reference: `references/rules/payments.md`

### 9. Accessibility
* **Verify.** Verify accessibility support such as VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type, contrast, and ensure compliance with accessibility standards like EN 301 549 / WCAG 2.1 AA.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "EU specific" & "Platform mechanics gate"
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `GOOGLE-PERM-ACCESSIBILITY-MISUSE`
  * Platform Mechanics: `docs/PLATFORM-MECHANICS-2026.md`

### 10. Legal Documents
* **Verify.** Verify that required legal declarations are in place (e.g., DSA trader status, child privacy/COPPA requirements, and EU AI Act Article 4/50 compliance).
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * EU Rules: `docs/EU-REGULATORY-2026.md`
  * Global Rules: `docs/GLOBAL-REGULATORY-2026.md`
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "EU specific" & "Global specific"

### 11. Support URL
* **Verify.** Confirm that a valid, reachable, and active support/contact URL is set in the metadata.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Shared (both stores)"
  * Script: `scripts/metadata-audit.py` (verifies URL availability when `--check-urls` is passed)
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `BOTH-UNREACHABLE-METADATA-URL`

### 12. Privacy Policy
* **Verify.** A clear and accurate Privacy Policy URL must be published, reachable in-app, and declared in the store listing.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Privacy and data"
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `APPLE-5.1.1-MISSING-PRIVACY-POLICY` & `GOOGLE-MISSING-PRIVACY-POLICY`
  * Script: `scripts/metadata-audit.py` (ensures privacy url is not missing)

### 13. Terms of Service
* **Verify.** Terms of Service or End User License Agreement (EULA) must be present and linked, especially for subscriptions and UGC apps.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Monetization" & "Platform mechanics gate"

  * Script: `scripts/metadata-audit.py` (checks for terms in subscription listings)

### 14. Export Compliance & Encryption Declarations
* **Verify.** Check that encryption declarations (`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption`) are present in `Info.plist` and appropriate French ANSSI declaration is completed if distributing to France.
* **Playbook Mapping:**
  * Checklist: `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` -> "Apple specific"
  * Patterns: `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `APPLE-EXPORT-COMPLIANCE-MISSING`
  * Rules Reference: `references/rules/export.md`
  * Platform Mechanics: `docs/PLATFORM-MECHANICS-2026.md`

### 15. Cross-Platform Framework Coverage
* **Verify.** If the project is Flutter (`pubspec.yaml`), React Native/Expo (`package.json` deps), or Ionic/Capacitor/Cordova (`capacitor.config.*`, `config.xml`, or matching deps), confirm the framework-specific findings are addressed. Watch for privacy manifest aggregation gaps for plugin-wrapped native SDKs, undisclosed OTA JS-bundle updaters, the Guideline 4.2 thin-WebView-wrapper rejection, and deprecated UIWebView linkage.
* **Playbook Mapping**
  - Doc. `docs/CROSS-PLATFORM-FRAMEWORKS.md`
  - Guard. `agent-os/hooks/app-store-compliance-guard.sh` (Flutter/React Native/Ionic detection and checks)
  - Patterns. `data/rejection-patterns.json` -> `FLUTTER-PRIVACY-MANIFEST-MISSING`, `RN-OTA-UNDECLARED`, `RN-PRIVACY-MANIFEST-MISSING`, `IONIC-4.2-THIN-WRAPPER`, `IONIC-UIWEBVIEW-DEPRECATED`, `IONIC-PRIVACY-MANIFEST-MISSING`

## Release-Time Action Flow

For any software release, in this order:
1. **Run the Automated Guard.** Execute `bash agent-os/hooks/app-store-compliance-guard.sh /path/to/project`.
2. **Run Metadata Audit.** Run `python3 scripts/metadata-audit.py <metadata-dir>` if metadata is pulled.
3. **Run Manual Verifications.** Walk through `docs/PRE-SUBMISSION-CHECKLIST.md` line-by-line for any item the automated scanners cannot detect.
4. **Compile findings.** Report every issue found under a clear, severity-ranked findings table. No release is approved while a `critical` or `high` issue stands.
