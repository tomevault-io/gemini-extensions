## Source Of Truth

`docs/spec.md` is the protocol source of truth. Do not edit it as part of
implementation cleanup unless that is the explicit task. If code, tests, and the
spec disagree, treat the code or tests as suspect first.

## Common Commands

Use `just` recipes for normal workflows:

```bash
just check-all
just test-hermetic
just test-shielded-pool
just test-sdk-libs
just test-programs
just test-cli
just clippy
```

`just test-hermetic` is the whole suite that needs nothing running, and CI runs
these same suites on every push. `just test-all` adds the prover-backed suites,
and the validator suites stay in their own recipes. Those tiers sit behind the
`proofs` and `localnet` Cargo features, so a plain `cargo test -p <crate>` never
starts a prover.

Program tests that load real SBF binaries need the local builds:

```bash
just build-programs
```

### Per-clone port isolation (`ZOLANA_PORT_OFFSET`)

Localnet/prover-backed tests bind fixed ports (RPC 8899, photon 8784, prover
3001), so two clones running them at once contend. To isolate a clone, set a
single offset in a local `.env` (gitignored, auto-loaded by `just` via `set
dotenv-load`); the justfile shifts every service port by it and derives the
matching URLs:

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then set e.g. ZOLANA_PORT_OFFSET=100
```

Offset 100 -> RPC 8999, photon 8884, prover 3101. Use 0 / 100 / 200 / ... per
clone (stay below ~900). The justfile exports `ZOLANA_PROVER_URL`, and the
tests read `ZOLANA_LOCALNET_URL` / `ZOLANA_INDEXER_URL` / `ZOLANA_PROVER_URL`,
so the offset flows into every `just test-*` recipe. Individual
`ZOLANA_LOCALNET_RPC_PORT` / `ZOLANA_LOCALNET_PHOTON_PORT` /
`ZOLANA_LOCALNET_PROVER_PORT` (and the URL vars) still override the derived
value when set explicitly.

`ZOLANA_PROVER_URL` is the single source of truth for the prover: the client
connects there and `spawn_prover()` starts the spawned server on that URL's
port. Running `cargo test` directly (not via `just`) does not auto-load `.env`
-- export the vars yourself (`set -a; source .env; set +a`) or use `direnv`.

## Code Style

- Keep protocol math in one canonical implementation and reuse it from tests.
- Keep public SDK surface deliberate; test-only helpers belong under
  `program-tests` unless they are useful to external developers.
- Avoid compatibility shims for removed Light/legacy surfaces.
- Prefer small, explicit helpers over broad abstractions.
- Comments should explain invariants, security constraints, or non-obvious
  layout decisions. Remove comments that only narrate the code.
- Never add `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`. Restructure with the
  method-patterns skill instead: an operation struct holding all inputs plus a
  consuming method that takes only the signer/context (e.g.
  `EscrowSettle { .. }.sign(keypair, assets)`).
- Do not leak prover/circuit-internal terminology ("field element(s)",
  "witness") into public API names (types, methods, fields, modules of
  sdk-libs and sdk crates). SDK users think in proofs and their inputs: name
  such surfaces in that vocabulary (`ProofInputUtxo`, `proof_inputs`,
  `to_proof_inputs()`). Internal prover code (prover crates, Go circuits,
  private helpers) may keep the ZK terms.

## Testing

- Do not add tests that only exercise derived serialization, e.g. a borsh or
  wincode `serialize` -> `deserialize` round-trip asserting equality. They test
  the derive macro, not our code. Test behavior we actually implement
  (validation, field mapping, encode/decode logic, state transitions) instead.

## Pinocchio 0.11 API

This project uses Pinocchio, not Anchor. Key types and idioms:

- `AccountView` (not AccountInfo), `Address` (not Pubkey)
- `account.owned_by(&address)`, `account.is_signer()`, `account.address()`
- `account.try_borrow()` -> `Ref<[u8]>`, `account.try_borrow_mut()` -> `RefMut<[u8]>`
- `Ref::map(data, |d| bytemuck::from_bytes(d))` for zero-copy deserialization
- `Address::find_program_address(seeds, program_id)` -- only on Solana target, needs cfg gate
- `pinocchio::cpi::{Seed, Signer}` -- CPI signing (requires `cpi` feature)
- `pinocchio_system::create_account_with_minimum_balance_signed` -- handles both hot/cold path
- `pinocchio_system::check_id(address)` -- verify system program

## Instruction Module Pattern

**Simple instructions** (close, toggle, single-file):
- Single `.rs` file with `process_<name>_ix` containing parsing, validation, and logic inline
- `#[inline(always)]` for small functions, `#[inline(never)]` for larger ones

**Complex instructions** (create, migrate, execute):
- `mod.rs` -- declares submodules, exports `process_<name>_ix`
- `processor.rs` -- `process_<name>_ix` entry point with inline parsing/validation and business logic
- `init.rs` -- account initialization helpers (optional)
- `verify.rs` -- proof/data verification (optional)
- `apply.rs` -- state mutations during migrations (optional)

**Common structure in processor.rs:**
- Check `accounts.len() >= N`
- Validate signers, system program, PDA derivation (for creation only)
- Parse instruction data via `zero_copy_at()` or manual slicing
- Define `<Name>Accounts` struct for validated account references
- Call state helpers (`create_pda_account`, `State::init`, etc.)

**lib.rs dispatch:**
- Add `pub mod <instruction_name>;` + `use` import
- Add new tag to match: `N => process_<name>_ix(program_id, accounts, data),`

## State Struct Pattern

State structs live in `program-libs/interface/src/state/`. Reference:
`ShieldedPoolConfig`.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Pod, Zeroable)]
#[repr(C)]
pub struct MyState {
    pub discriminator: u8,       // first byte, from interface::state::discriminator constants
    pub field1: [u8; 32],
    pub bump: u8,
}
```

Required methods:
- `const SIZE: usize = core::mem::size_of::<Self>()`
- `const SEED: &[u8] = b"my_seed"` (for PDA-based accounts)
- `from_account_info_checked(account, program_id) -> Result<Ref<Self>, ProgramError>` -- validates owner + length + discriminator
- `init(account, ..fields, bump) -> Result<(), ProgramError>` -- checks `data[0] == 0`, writes discriminator + fields via bytemuck

Add discriminator constant to `program-libs/interface/src/state/discriminator.rs`.

## Error Pattern

All program errors must be defined in the interface crate
(`program-libs/interface/src/error.rs`), including the `From<...> for
ProgramError` conversion. The program crate does not define its own error enum;
it imports `zolana_interface::error::ShieldedPoolError`, and clients import the
same definition.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Error, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum ShieldedPoolError {
    #[error("description")]
    Variant = 7000,
}
```

- The `ProgramError` conversion target is `solana_program_error::ProgramError`,
  which Pinocchio re-exports as `pinocchio::error::ProgramError` (same type), so
  the interface crate depends on `solana-program-error`, not `pinocchio`:

  ```rust
  impl From<ShieldedPoolError> for ProgramError {
      fn from(e: ShieldedPoolError) -> Self {
          ProgramError::Custom(e as u32)
      }
  }
  ```

- Meaningful errors: every fallible path must return a specific, named variant
  that describes what failed. Do not reuse an unrelated variant as a catch-all
  and do not return a bare `ProgramError::Custom`/generic error at call sites
  when a precise variant exists or could be added.

- Error codes live in the `7000` space. Pin every code in the
  `error_codes_are_stable` test. Once a code is observable by tests or clients,
  do not renumber it casually.

## PDA Helpers

- Account creation helpers should delegate to the Pinocchio system helpers,
  handle both hot path (`lamports == 0`) and cold path (attacker donated
  lamports), and keep signer seed handling local to the creation path.
- `verify_pda(account_key, seeds, program_id) -> Result<u8, ProgramError>` must
  be cfg-gated: use `Address::find_program_address` on Solana target and do not
  pretend host tests can derive it unless a host implementation exists.

## Instruction Builder Pattern (interface crate)

Builders live in `program-libs/interface/src/instruction/builders/`. Reference:
`create_pool_tree.rs`

```rust
use solana_instruction::{AccountMeta, Instruction};
use solana_pubkey::Pubkey;
use crate::{instruction::{tag, CreatePoolTreeData}, SHIELDED_POOL_PROGRAM_ID};

pub fn create_pool_tree(payer: Pubkey, tree: Pubkey, data: CreatePoolTreeData) -> Instruction {
    let mut instruction_data = vec![tag::CREATE_POOL_TREE];
    data.serialize(&mut instruction_data)
        .expect("shielded-pool instruction serialization is infallible");

    Instruction {
        program_id: Pubkey::new_from_array(SHIELDED_POOL_PROGRAM_ID),
        accounts: vec![AccountMeta::new(payer, true), AccountMeta::new(tree, false)],
        data: instruction_data,
    }
}
```

- Use canonical program ids from `program-libs/interface/src/lib.rs`, do not pass as parameter
- Use fixed-size arrays for instruction data, not Vec, when the instruction data is fixed
- Add `pub mod <name>;` + `pub use <name>::<item>;` to `program-libs/interface/src/instruction/builders/mod.rs`
- Builders are imported in tests as `zolana_interface::instruction::<builder>`

### Instruction data

1. use [instruction-decoder](https://github.com/helius-labs/privacy-program-libs/tree/main/crates/instruction-decoder)
2. default light-zero-copy
3. if not hot path can use borsh

### wincode length prefixes (zolana-transaction)

When choosing the length encoding for a wincode `containers::Vec<T, FixIntLen<..>>`:
- `Vec<u8>` (byte vectors: ciphertexts, program/ring data, can exceed 255 bytes) use `FixIntLen<u16>`.
- every other vector (element counts: records, recipient slots, recipient viewing keys; always small) use `FixIntLen<u8>`.

### Accounts

1. instructions that transfer lamports take a fee payer account; instructions that do not must not take one
2. no need to verify pda derivation for initialized accounts: checking discriminator and program ownership is enough if access control does not rely on the derivation itself. If access control relies on the derivation, store the bump in the account data or send it in instruction data; account data is cleaner if the account has data
3. Every account that is read or written to must be accessed with a load prefixed function that is defined in a loader.rs file
4. PDA creation must use canonical bumps derived via `find_program_address` (verify_pda), never accept bumps from instruction data for account creation
5. init pattern:
    - must use a param struct with an init method `pub fn init(self, account: &AccountView) -> ProgramResult {`
    - must check that account is not already initialized
    - no program id check necessary; the SVM does not allow writes to an account owned by another program
    - all account struct fields must be initialized
    - account size must match the account struct size exactly
6. Recovery and owner encryption keys
    - the owner needs to sign to add or remove encryption keys other than auditor keys
7. all signer checks must be in the processor not nested inside of other functions
8. closing accounts
    - every account close instruction must have a dedicated rent_recipient

### Crate hierarchy

1. the program must only depend on the interface crate and possibly other low level crates that pull in as few dependencies as possible; it must not depend on its own sdks
2. sdks must not depend on test-utils, neither in deps nor dev-deps

### Proof generation for tests

1. Loading proving keys for big circuits takes a lot of time
2. tests should start a prover server if not started yet
3. The prover server should be lazy: load no proving keys on startup, load a key when a proof for it is first requested, then keep it loaded

## SPP Transaction Proving Keys & Verifying Keys

The `transfer` (eddsa, Solana-only rail) and `transfer_p256` (P256 ownership
rail) circuits live in `prover/server/circuits/spp_transaction/`. Their proving
systems are per-shape (`<nInputs>x<nOutputs>`); the supported shape set is
duplicated in four places that MUST stay in sync:
`sdk-libs/client/src/shape.rs` (the client may use a subset), Go
`prover-test/spp/protocol/shape.go` (`SupportedShapes`), Go
`prover/common/lazy_key_manager.go` (`transferSupportedShapes`), and the
shielded-pool verifier when it exists (`transact/proof.rs`).

### Generate proving keys (`.key`)

```bash
# All supported shapes, both rails -> prover/server/proving-keys/<rail>_<in>_<out>.key
prover/server/scripts/generate_keys_transfer.sh

# One shape directly (--circuit flag = transfer (eddsa) | transfer-p256).
# Key files mirror the vk modules: transfer_<shape>.key / transfer_p256_<shape>.key.
cd prover/server && go build -o light-prover .
./light-prover setup-transfer --circuit transfer-p256 --n-inputs 2 --n-outputs 3 \
    --output proving-keys/transfer_p256_2_3.key
```

`setup-transfer` runs `groth16.Setup` and writes the full `TransferProofSystem`
(pk+vk+ccs). Keys are gitignored. The server lazy-loads
`proving-keys/<rail>_<in>_<out>.key` on first proof request for that shape.

### Distribute proving keys via S3 + CloudFront

The gitignored proving keys (transfer, merge, and the forester's batch
address-append) are distributed from a private S3 bucket fronted by CloudFront;
reads are credential-free (the keys are PUBLIC setup parameters, not secrets).
Which keys, their `sha256`, and the version-hashed prefix
(`proving-keys/<hash>/<name>.key`) are pinned by the committed lockfile
`prover/server/prover/provingkeys/proving-keys.lock`, embedded into the prover by
the `provingkeys` package -- it IS the proving-key version and changes in the same
commit as the verifying keys, so pk<->vk<->code drift is impossible.

The downloader (`EnsureProvingKey` in `key_downloader.go`) is cache-first: verify
an on-disk key against the lockfile `sha256` (offline), else HTTPS-GET
`<base>/<prefix>/<name>` and hard-fail unless the bytes match the pinned `size` +
`sha256`. The base URL defaults to the CloudFront domain defined in
`key_downloader.go` and is overridable with `ZOLANA_PROVING_KEYS_URL`; no GitHub
token, release tag, or `CHECKSUM`. Version-hashed folders are immutable, so a
rotation writes a NEW folder and leaves old ones untouched (old CLI -> old keys,
new CLI -> new keys; no CloudFront invalidation). CI caches
`prover/server/proving-keys` keyed by the lockfile hash.

Rotate keys with (needs the aws CLI + bucket write access):

```bash
prover/server/scripts/rotate_proving_keys.sh   # regen keys + vkeys + lock; upload new version folder
```

It regenerates the proving keys, the interface + nullifier-tree verifying
keys, the circuit fingerprints, and `proving-keys.lock`, then uploads the full set
to the new `proving-keys/<version-hash>/` folder. Commit the regenerated lockfile
together with the vkeys in ONE PR.

### Regenerate Rust verifying keys (`program-libs/interface/src/verifying_keys/`)

```bash
prover/server/scripts/regenerate_all_vkeys.sh
```

Pipeline: `light-prover export-vk` writes the gnark `WriteRawTo` (uncompressed)
vk binary, then `cargo run -p xtask -- bsb22-vk <vk_bin> <out_dir> <filename>`
calls `groth16_solana::gnark_vk_parser::generate_bsb22_vk_file` to emit a
`pub const VERIFYINGKEY: Groth16Verifyingkey` per circuit, and `mod.rs` is
regenerated. The codegen lives in the `xtask` crate, which depends on the
`groth16-solana` fork (`../groth16-solana`, `features = ["bsb22"]`).
`zolana-interface` depends on the same fork only to compile the committed
`verifying_keys/*.rs` constants.

### BSB22 commitments (the two rails differ on purpose)

- **transfer_p256 (P256):** the emulated-P256 gadget adds one BSB22 commitment over
  private wires. Its vk has `vk_commitment_g2: Some(..)` and `vk_ic.len() ==
  public_inputs + 2`. Proofs include `proofCommitment` + `proofCommitmentPok`.
  Verify with `Groth16Verifier::new_with_commitment`.
- **transfer (eddsa, Solana-only):** standard Groth16, zero commitments. Its vk
  has `vk_commitment_g2: None` and `vk_ic.len() == public_inputs + 1`. Verify
  with `Groth16Verifier::new`.

Both verify in one binary built with the `bsb22` feature: `verify_common` runs
the standard Groth16 pairing for every proof and only adds the Pedersen PoK
pairing when a commitment is present. Dispatch on `vk.vk_commitment_g2.is_some()`
(or the rail). The Go prover marshals `proofCommitment` as `omitempty`, so it is
absent for the eddsa rail and present for the P256 rail.

NOTE: the parser/verifier support a single commitment over **private** wires
only (empty `committed_wires`). Committing a **public** input (e.g.
`committer.Commit(c.PublicInputHash)`) records that wire in
`PublicAndCommitmentCommitted` and the parser rejects it with
`Bsb22UnsupportedMultiCommitment`. The eddsa rail must therefore stay standard
Groth16 (no explicit `Commit`), not force a public-wire commitment.

## Releasing The TypeScript SDK

`@heliuslabs/zolana` publishes manually with `npm publish` from `sdk-libs/ts`
and documents through the `ts-sdk-v<version>` tag workflow. Every
published-surface change updates `sdk-libs/ts/CHANGELOG.md` in the same
branch, written under `sdk-libs/ts/CHANGELOG-RULES.md`. `prepublishOnly`
refuses an undated or missing entry.

## Releasing Photon

Photon lives at `services/photon` and is a member of this Cargo workspace. Build
the operational binary with `just build-photon`; localnet and CI must run that
same-revision binary rather than a downloaded release artifact. Photon consumes
the workspace `zolana-event`, `zolana-interface`, and `zolana-tree` crates, so
program layouts and indexer parsing change atomically.

Production containers are built from the repository root so Cargo can resolve
workspace path dependencies:

```bash
docker build -f services/photon/Dockerfile .
```

Photon keeps its own deployment approval even though it shares source and a
lockfile with the protocol. Release images must be immutable, identify the
Zolana repository commit, and include the root license and third-party notices.
Localnet tests never consume those production images.

From the commit on `main` to release, create and push its fork tag:

```bash
tag="photon-zolana-$(git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD)"
git tag "$tag"
git push origin "$tag"
```

A manual `publish-image.yml` dispatch on the `release` channel must use that
same commit-derived value for its `image_tag`, and the commit must be on
`main`; the `preview` channel takes any branch and any tag, for images that are
not releases, and refuses a `-zolana-` tag so a preview cannot claim a release
name. The protected `image-publish` environment gates publication. The workflow
publishes the `photon-zolana-<12-character-commit>` tag and a full `sha-<commit>`
alias, refuses to overwrite either, and does not publish `latest`. The imported
crate version in `services/photon/Cargo.toml` is upstream source provenance, not
the Zolana fork's release identifier.

Before archiving the standalone Photon repository, update external deployment
configuration that consumes its old `<run>-<sha>` or `latest` tags to use a new
immutable `photon-zolana-*` or `sha-*` tag from this repository. Keep the
base-image digests in `services/photon/Dockerfile`, `forester/Dockerfile` and
`prover/server/Dockerfile.light` updated through reviewed changes -- all three
images are attested, and a mutable base tag would let one commit produce
different bytes.

## Git Hygiene

The worktree may contain user changes. Do not revert unrelated edits. Keep PRs
small when possible: protocol/program changes, tooling cleanup, and prover
renames should be split unless the task explicitly asks for a combined change.

## Solana account deserialization
- never deserialize an account twice

1. use solana_address::Address NOT solana_pubkey::Pubkey which is an alias of Address
