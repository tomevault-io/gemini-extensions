## What TermUI is

TermUI is a TypeScript framework for building terminal apps. It is a CLI library, not a web app. There is no DOM, no browser, no React. Output goes to a terminal through a cell grid and ANSI escape codes.

It is a Bun workspace monorepo with 14 packages under `packages/`. Each package publishes as `@termuijs/<name>`.

## Commands

Run all commands from the repo root. Use Bun. Never use npm, yarn, or npx.

```bash
bun install                          # install dependencies
bun run build                        # build all packages
bun run typecheck                    # type check all packages
bun run lint                         # lint all packages
bun vitest run packages/<name>       # test one package (use this while iterating)
bun vitest run                       # test everything
```

Before you open a PR, run these three and make sure they pass:

```bash
bun run build && bun vitest run && bun run typecheck
```

## Package layout

```
packages/
  core/              Screen buffer, layout engine, input, events, caps, KeyEvent
  widgets/           Box, Text, Table, Gauge, Sparkline, Tree, and 40+ display widgets
  ui/                Select, Tabs, Modal, Toggle, Wizard, prompts, compound widgets
  jsx/               JSX runtime and React-style hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer)
  store/             Global state with selectors and subscribe
  tss/               Terminal Style Sheets: variables, selectors, themes
  motion/            Spring and easing animations; respects NO_MOTION
  router/            Screen routing with typed params and guards
  data/              System data: CPU, memory, disk, processes, network
  testing/           In-memory test renderer
  dev-server/        Hot-reload dev server (Bun-native)
  quick/             Fluent builder API
  create-termui-app/ Project scaffolding CLI
  adapters/          Adapters for external CLI libraries
```

A widget package follows this layout:

```
packages/widgets/src/data/
  Gauge.ts           main widget
  Gauge.test.ts      tests, same directory
```

Public exports go through the package `index.ts`.

## Canonical reference

When you add a widget, read `packages/widgets/src/data/Gauge.ts` and `packages/widgets/src/data/Gauge.test.ts` first. Copy their structure. Match the comment style, the constructor signature shape, the `markDirty()` calls, and the test layout.

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode. No `any`. No `@ts-ignore`. No type assertions without an inline comment explaining why.
- Named exports only. Never `export default`.
- Use the `node:` prefix for Node built-ins: `import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'`, not `'fs'`.
- No external runtime dependencies in `@termuijs/core`. Core stays dependency-free.
- Import shared types from `@termuijs/core`. Do not redefine `Screen`, `KeyEvent`, `Color`, `Style`.
- A widget that handles keys takes `handleKey(event: KeyEvent)` from `@termuijs/core`. Key names are lowercase: `enter`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `space`, `escape`, `tab`, `home`, `end`. Never `Enter`, `ArrowUp`.
- Every state-mutating method on a widget calls `this.markDirty()`.
- Use `caps.unicode` for non-ASCII characters with an ASCII fallback. Example: `caps.unicode ? '█' : '#'`.
- No `console.log` in source files.

## Testing

- Framework: Vitest. Tests sit next to source as `<Name>.test.ts`.
- Run one package: `bun vitest run packages/<name>`.
- Tests must use the real `Screen` from `@termuijs/core`. Do not write a fake screen object.
- Render a widget in a test like this:

```ts
import { Screen } from '@termuijs/core';
const screen = new Screen(40, 10);
widget.updateRect({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 40, height: 10 });
widget.render(screen);
const row0 = screen.back[0].map(c => c.char).join('');
expect(row0).toContain('expected text');
```

- To test `caps.unicode` or `caps.motion` behavior, use `vi.spyOn`, never direct mutation:

```ts
import { vi } from 'vitest';
vi.spyOn(caps, 'unicode', 'get').mockReturnValue(false);
// add afterEach(() => vi.restoreAllMocks());
```

Do not write `caps.unicode = false`. It mutates shared state and leaks across tests.

- Tests must be real. `expect(true).toBe(true)` and `expect(widget).toBeDefined()` are not tests. Assert observable behavior or rendered output.

## Boundaries

### Always

- Run `bun run build && bun vitest run && bun run typecheck` before opening a PR.
- Confine your change to the package the issue names.
- Export new public APIs from the package `index.ts`.
- Follow conventional commits: `feat(widgets): add Gauge widget`, `fix(core): handle empty row`, `test(ui): add Toggle tests`.
- Link the issue in the PR body: `Closes #123`.

### Ask first (comment on the issue before doing it)

- Adding a new dependency.
- Modifying `packages/core/` or any shared type.
- Changing an existing public API signature.
- Adding a new package to the workspace.

### Never

- Use npm, yarn, or npx. Bun only.
- Use `export default`.
- Use `any` without an inline comment.
- Edit `bun.lock` by hand. If your change needs a dependency, add it to the package `package.json` and run `bun install`. Do not hand-edit lockfile entries, and do not commit unrelated lockfile churn (turbo version bumps, removed packages, blank-line shuffles). If `bun.lock` shows changes unrelated to your work, revert it: `git checkout origin/main -- bun.lock`.
- Touch files outside the package scope the issue states.
- Bundle refactors, formatting, or "while I was here" changes into a feature PR. One change per PR.
- Import Bun-only types like `Timer` or `import ... from 'bun'`. Published packages run on Node 18+. Use `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` instead of `Timer`.
- Commit with failing tests or TypeScript errors.
- Leave placeholder tests.

## Monorepo rules

- Each package is independent. Do not import between packages unless the issue says to. The dependency direction is: `core` <- everything, `widgets` <- `ui`.
- When an issue says "confined to packages/X", touch nothing else.
- Run `bun install` from the repo root, never from inside a package.
- A new example under `examples/` adds one workspace entry to `bun.lock`. Do not let `bun install` rewrite unrelated parts of the lockfile.

## GSSoC note

This repo runs in GSSoC 2026. PRs need a linked issue, passing checks, and a starred repo. Labels (`gssoc:approved`, `level:*`, `quality:*`) are set by the maintainer after review. Do not add them yourself.
