## BROWSER UUID AUTHORIZATION

OpenBrowser now uses the browser UUID as a capability token, not just an internal identifier.

### Permission Model

1. Chrome extension connects to the server WebSocket
2. Server assigns a `connection_id`
3. Extension registers its current browser UUID with `POST /browsers/register`
4. Server stores `browser_uuid -> websocket`
5. Frontend or API client asks the user for the browser UUID
6. Message/command requests include `browser_id`
7. Server validates `browser_id` and routes browser commands only to that registered websocket

### Key Invariants

- The browser UUID is the secret required to control that browser
- Possession of the UUID implies permission to operate that browser
- `browser_id` is required on browser-control requests unless already stored in conversation metadata
- Browser routing must be single-target by UUID, not broadcast to all websockets
- Frontend flow lives in `frontend/index.html`
- UUID registration and validation live in `server/api/routes/browsers.py`, `server/core/uuid_manager.py`, and `server/websocket/manager.py`

## RECORD & REPLAY DESIGN

OpenBrowser's record/replay system is deliberately not a raw event replayer. The recording trace is evidence used to understand what the human did, compile a reusable Browser Routine, and debug failures later. Replay runs that compiled Routine as a fresh agent session.

### Pipeline
```
1. POST /recordings
2. Extension recorder starts in `dedicated_window` (default) or `current_window`
3. Recorder captures scoped browser events + selective keyframes
4. POST /recordings/{id}/events persists rows while the session is ACTIVE
5. POST /recordings/{id}/stop freezes the trace
6. GET /recordings/{id}/workflow-draft builds normalized steps / workflow IR
7. POST /recordings/{id}/compile runs the Compiler Agent over raw events, keyframes, normalized steps, and `intent_note`
8. Compiler may ask clarification questions, then emits validated Routine markdown
9. POST /recordings/{id}/compile/finalize saves a named Routine in `routines`
10. Frontend replay starts a fresh conversation with `mode="routine_replay"` and sends the Routine markdown as the first message
```

### Core Design Rules
- Replay is **NOT** low-level click/scroll/input playback
- Raw recording events are a source artifact for review, compilation, and debugging
- `workflow-draft` is intermediate IR for review/compiler context, not the final replay format
- The executable replay artifact is the finalized Routine markdown saved in `routines`
- Saved routines keep a back-reference to `source_recording_id`

### Recording Invariants
- Only one ACTIVE recording may exist per browser UUID
- Default launch mode is `dedicated_window`; `current_window` is opt-in
- The recorder owns a recording scope (window/group/tab set) and automatically absorbs new in-scope tabs
- `recording_started` and `recording_stopped` are ambient lifecycle events; they should not compile into replay steps
- Once a recording leaves ACTIVE, `/recordings/{id}/events` must reject late async uploads so the reviewed trace stays immutable
- If the browser websocket is gone at stop time, the server marks the row STOPPED locally with `stop_reason=browser_disconnected` instead of leaving it stranded ACTIVE
- `page_view` intentionally does **not** carry a keyframe; early lifecycle captures were observed to distort the live Chrome page
- Keyframes are selective: mainly `click`, `change`, `submit`, and input-like `focus`; some click/enter flows use pre-action captures, and post-capture screenshots are discarded if the capture already drifted to a different URL
- Input/focus noise is merged before review/compiler consumption so the trace reflects intent instead of every transient keystroke

### Replay Invariants
- Replay always starts a **fresh conversation** with metadata `mode="routine_replay"`
- `routine_replay_mode` is a server-side flag propagated from session metadata into system prompt rendering; the model never infers replay mode from free-form text
- The frontend replay entry points are the saved-routine launcher and the `/` slash-menu routine picker in `frontend/index.html`
- Small-model `highlight_elements(keywords=...)` is only allowed in routine replay, and the token must be copied verbatim from the active Routine step's `**Keywords:**` line

### Evaluation Hooks
- `eval/routine_eval/` has a compile track and a replay track
- The compile track can ingest fixture traces through `POST /recordings/ingest`, gated by `OPENBROWSER_ENABLE_TEST_ROUTES=1`
- The replay track executes golden routines in `routine_replay` mode on the mock sites

## DIALOG HANDLING

When JavaScript triggers a dialog (alert/confirm/prompt), the browser pauses.
OpenBrowser uses Promise.race to detect dialogs gracefully.

### Flow
```
1. javascript_execute runs
2. Promise.race([
     jsExecution,    // Runtime.evaluate
     dialogEvent,    // Page.javascriptDialogOpening
     timeout         // User timeout
   ])
3. If dialog opens:
   - Return dialog info to the screenshot/handling flow
   - Wait for screenshot handling or explicit dialog response
4. AI calls handle_dialog(accept/dismiss)
5. Extension handles, checks cascade
```

### Dialog Types
| Type | Needs Decision | AI Action |
|------|----------------|----------|
| alert | No | Auto-accepted |
| confirm | Yes | handle_dialog(accept/dismiss) |
| prompt | Yes | handle_dialog(accept, text) |
| beforeunload | Yes | handle_dialog(accept/dismiss) |

### Cascading Dialogs
Dialog → Dialog → Dialog chain supported. After handling one dialog,
the system checks for new dialogs within 150ms.

### Element Actions Dialog Handling
When JavaScript execution triggers a dialog during element actions (click, hover, scroll, keyboard input), the `executeJavaScript` function returns a result with `dialog_opened: true` but no `result` field. Element action functions (`performElementClick`, `performElementHover`, etc.) must check for `jsResult.dialog_opened` before checking `jsResult.result?.value`. If a dialog opened, treat the action as successful (clicked/hovered/scrolled/input = true) and propagate dialog info to the screenshot handler. This prevents false "Invalid JavaScript result.value structure" errors.

## CONVENTIONS

### Python (server/)
- **Line length:** 88 (black/ruff)
- **Target:** Python 3.12
- **Strict typing:** `disallow_untyped_defs = true` in mypy
- **Imports:** isort via ruff

### TypeScript (extension/)
- **Target:** ES2022
- **Module:** ESNext with bundler resolution
- **Strict mode:** enabled
- **Path alias:** `@/*` → `src/*`
- **Build:** Vite with multi-entry (background, content, workers)

## PROMPT MANAGEMENT

OpenBrowser uses Jinja2 templates for agent prompts, enabling dynamic content injection based on configuration.

### Template Structure
- **Location**: `server/agent/prompts/` directory
- **Format**: `.j2` extension with Jinja2 syntax
- **4 Tool Templates**: Each of the 4 focused tools has its own template:
  - `tab_tool.j2` - Tab management documentation
  - `highlight_tool.j2` - Element discovery with color coding
  - `element_interaction_tool.j2` - 2PC flow with orange confirmations
  - `dialog_tool.j2` - Dialog handling

### Template Features
- **Conditional rendering**: Use `{% if %}` blocks for configurable sections
- **Variable injection**: Pass context variables like model profile flags at render time
- **Clean output**: `trim_blocks=True` and `lstrip_blocks=True` remove extra whitespace
- **Caching**: Templates are cached after first load for performance

### Model Profile Differences
- Model profile is resolved from session metadata and exposed to prompt rendering as `model_profile` / `small_model`; see `server/agent/manager.py` and `server/agent/tools/prompt_context.py`
- Tool prompt variants are split by model profile under `server/agent/prompts/small_model/` and `server/agent/prompts/big_model/`
- Small-model browser guidance intentionally avoids `keywords` fallback and leans harder on same-mode highlight pagination when dense UI may be split across collision-aware pages
- Observation rendering now includes clickable element HTML for all model profiles; prompt differences still vary by model profile

### Keyword Discipline
- Highlight pagination remains the default discovery flow for controls and dense UI
- After any significant page-state change, restart discovery with `highlight_elements(element_type="any")` before choosing the next element
- `keywords` are allowed only when copying exact observed readable text or exact stable tokens already visible in the screenshot/highlight HTML
- Do not use guessed labels, unread text, or icon-only tokens such as `×` or `🔍` as keyword probes

## ANTI-PATTERNS (THIS PROJECT)

- **NEVER use pixel-based mouse/keyboard simulation** - All operations via JavaScript execution
- **NEVER skip conversation_id** - Required for multi-session isolation
- **NEVER return DOM nodes from JavaScript** - Must be JSON-serializable
- **NEVER use `.click()` for React/Vue** - Dispatch full event sequence instead
- **NEVER suppress type errors** - `as any`, `@ts-ignore` forbidden
- **NEVER ignore dialog_opened** - AI must handle dialogs before continuing
## VISUAL INTERACTION WORKFLOW

OpenBrowser uses a visual-first approach where the AI sees elements before interacting:

### Workflow
```
1. highlight_elements(element_type="any", page=1) → Returns mixed interactive elements with IDs
2. screenshot → AI sees numbered overlays on elements (no overlap)
3. click_element(id="click-3") → Interact with specific element
4. If the page changed significantly, highlight_elements(element_type="any", page=1) again before choosing the next element
5. If the current page state is unchanged and the target is still missing, continue highlight_elements(element_type="any", page=2)
```

### Collision-Aware Pagination (Single-Type Design)
Elements are paginated to ensure **no visual overlap** in each screenshot:
- **One element type per call** for stable, predictable pagination
- Each page returns a maximal set of non-colliding elements
- Collision detection includes label area (26px above element)
- AI calls `page=1, page=2, page=3...` to see all elements of that type
- No offset/limit - pages are determined by collision geometry

### Highlight Readiness Behavior

- `highlight_elements` now uses a **snapshot-first** readiness check instead of page-side polling loops.
- Reason: OpenBrowser intentionally keeps automated tabs in the browser background, and Chrome may heavily throttle hidden-tab timers. A page-side `setTimeout` stability loop can therefore take far longer than its nominal budget and become the main cause of highlight timeouts.
- In practice, the main cause of unstable first-highlight screenshots is often **missing warmup**, not a bad readiness classifier. A background tab may answer lightweight `Runtime.evaluate` probes while still sitting in a partially painted / partially decoded state.
- A screenshot-style warmup is therefore the default precondition for `highlight_elements`. It helps force hidden-tab paint/compositor/image-decode work before interactive-element detection runs.
- All highlight warmup and highlight screenshot captures now reuse the same screenshot wake-up profile as `tab view` (`TAB_VIEW_SCREENSHOT_CAPTURE_OPTIONS`) instead of a weaker highlight-only profile. The goal is consistency: if a screenshot is needed to wake the page, the highlight path should not use a different, less effective capture mode.
- For navigation-driven default observations such as `tab init`, `tab open`, `tab switch`, `tab refresh`, `tab back`, and `tab forward`, the extension now performs an **internal raw screenshot prime** first, then runs the normal highlight warmup + detection + highlighted screenshot flow. That raw prime screenshot is only for waking the background page and is **not** returned to the agent.
- If `highlight_elements` keeps returning `not_ready` but `tab view` immediately makes the next highlight succeed, treat that as a warmup issue first.
- The extension samples viewport readiness signals once per attempt: document readiness, viewport text/media density, pending images, and loading placeholders such as skeleton/shimmer/spinner indicators.
- Readiness is graded as `ready`, `provisionally_ready`, or `not_ready`.
- If readiness is `not_ready`, the extension performs only a couple of short **background-side** retries before proceeding or returning the latest result.
- The screenshot-side wake-up itself also runs a bounded pre-capture warmup loop. It touches visible viewport media, samples readiness, and retries only a couple of times when the snapshot still looks `not_ready`.
- After screenshot capture, highlight still runs a **consistency check**. This is a drift detector, not a loading detector: it verifies whether sampled highlighted elements moved or disappeared between detection and screenshot.
- Design rule: prefer snapshot classification plus bounded retries; avoid depending on repeated timers inside the target page for highlight stability.

```
# Highlight mixed elements first (default)
highlight_elements()                              → Page 1 of any interactive elements
highlight_elements(page=2)                         → Page 2 of the current page state's any results
highlight_elements(element_type="any", page=1)    → Explicit any-first discovery

# Highlight other types (one at a time)
highlight_elements(element_type="inputable")   → Input fields
highlight_elements(element_type="scrollable")  → Scrollable areas
highlight_elements(element_type="selectable")  → Native select dropdowns
highlight_elements(element_type="clickable")   → Targeted fallback for icon-only controls after any-first discovery
```

### Element ID Format
Elements are identified by a 6-character hash string:
- Format: `[a-z0-9]{6}` (e.g., "a3f2b1", "9z8x7c")
- Algorithm: FNV-1a hash of CSS selector, encoded in base36
- Deterministic: Same element always gets same ID across page reloads
- Example IDs: "a3f2b1", "k9m4p2", "7x3n1q"
| `hover_element` | Hover by element ID | `{element_id: "9z8x7c"}` |
| `scroll_element` | Scroll by element ID | `{element_id: "m5k2p8", direction: "down"}` |
| `keyboard_input` | Type into element | `{element_id: "j4n7q1", text: "hello"}` |

### Tool Mapping (4-Tool Architecture)
The visual interaction workflow is implemented across 4 focused tools:

| Tool | Commands | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `tab` | `tab init`, `tab open`, `tab close`, `tab switch`, `tab list`, `tab refresh`, `tab view`, `tab back`, `tab forward` | Session and tab management |
| `highlight` | `highlight_elements` | Element discovery with blue overlays |
| `element_interaction` | `click_element`, `confirm_click_element`, `hover_element`, `scroll_element`, `keyboard_input`, `confirm_keyboard_input`, `select_element`, `confirm_select` | Element interaction with 2PC for click, keyboard input, and select |
| `dialog` | `handle_dialog` | Dialog handling (accept/dismiss) |

## UNIQUE PATTERNS

### Multi-Session Tab Isolation
- `tab init <url>` creates managed session with tab group
- `conversation_id` ties all commands to session
- Tab groups provide visual isolation ("OpenBrowser" group)

### 2-Strike Rule
If operation fails twice:
1. Try full event sequence (pointerdown → mousedown → click)
2. Inspect DOM structure
3. Consider direct URL navigation

## PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Selective 2PC
- `click_element`, `keyboard_input`, and `select_element` require a YELLOW confirmation preview followed by `confirm_click_element`, `confirm_keyboard_input`, or `confirm_select`
- `select` confirmation messages also echo the chosen `value` so the agent can verify option text against the rendered `<option>` list
- `hover_element`, `scroll_element`, and `swipe_element` execute immediately and return the post-action screenshot
- Starting a different action clears any pending confirmation from a previous `click_element`, `keyboard_input`, or `select_element`

## SISYPHUS MODE

Automated looping mode for repetitive testing and monitoring.

### Configuration
1. Click the "🔄 Sisyphus" button in the status bar (next to Settings)
2. Configure prompts in the Prompts tab (add/remove/edit)
3. Enable Sisyphus mode in the Settings tab
4. Save configuration

### Behavior
- When enabled, the command input field is replaced with START/STOP buttons
- Click START to begin the Sisyphus loop:
  1. Creates a new conversation session (fresh conversation ID)
  2. Sends prompts in configured order
  3. Waits for each conversation to complete before sending next prompt
  4. After all prompts, repeats from step 1 with a new session
- Loop continues indefinitely until STOP is clicked

### Use Cases
- Automated testing of multi-step workflows
- Continuous monitoring of dynamic web pages
- Repetitive data collection tasks
- Stress testing browser interactions

### Storage
Configuration is saved to `localStorage` (key: `openbrowser_sisyphus_config`).

### Browser Selection

- Sisyphus still requires a browser UUID in the frontend before starting
- The UUID is stored separately from the conversation ID
- Changing browser UUID in the frontend clears the active conversation binding

## COMMANDS

```bash
# Start server (HTTP 8765, WebSocket 8766)
uv run local-chrome-server serve
uv run local-chrome-server serve --multi-process     # one worker process per conversation

# Build extension
cd extension && npm run build

# Server tests (pytest, async mode auto, paths under server/tests)
uv run pytest                                                                # all
uv run pytest server/tests/unit/test_recording_routes.py                     # one file
uv run pytest server/tests/unit/test_recording_routes.py::TestName::test_x   # one test
uv run pytest -m integration                                                 # needs running server + extension
```

## SCREENSHOT BEHAVIOR

OpenBrowser has explicit screenshot control for maximum flexibility:

- Screenshots also serve as a practical page warmup mechanism for background tabs. They can unblock page paint and media decode work that passive DOM/readiness inspection does not reliably trigger on its own.
- Screenshot output sizing must not rely on `Page.captureScreenshot` with `clip.scale < 1` on a live tab.
- Reason: scaled CDP captures were reproduced to leave the visible page shrunk into the top-left corner, including during recording.
- Preferred strategy: capture at the tab's natural device-pixel size first, then downscale/compress offline inside the extension.

### Recording Keyframes

- Recording keyframes must **not** be attached to `page_view` events.
- Reason: `page_view` is emitted during content-script `resume` / `start-recording` after refresh or reload, which is earlier than a stable post-load milestone.
- Capturing a screenshot in that early `page_view` phase was reproduced to shrink the live Chrome page into the top-left corner during recording sessions.
- `tab_ready` should stay as a lifecycle event and must not be the sole source of recording screenshots.
- Reason: on slow pages, users often start interacting while the tab still reports loading; waiting for `tab_ready` can miss the meaningful pre-load-complete actions entirely.
- Prefer action-timed keyframes on `click` / `submit`, but discard them when the captured screenshot has already drifted to a different URL than the source event page. This preserves useful action context without trusting navigation-transition screenshots.
- Recording output size limits such as `960x540` should be enforced only by offline downscale/compression after a full-size capture, never by CDP `clip.scale`.
- Action-timed recording keyframes may include an in-image bbox/banner annotation for the acted-on element (or submitted form) so review UI can show exactly what the user just clicked or typed into.

### Commands That Return Screenshots

| Command | Auto-Screenshot | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| `tab init` | Yes | Returns default `highlight any page 1`; first does an internal raw screenshot prime to wake the page |
| `tab open` | Yes | Returns default `highlight any page 1`; first does an internal raw screenshot prime to wake the page |
| `tab switch` | Yes | Returns default `highlight any page 1`; first does an internal raw screenshot prime to wake the page |
| `tab refresh` | Yes | Returns default `highlight any page 1`; first does an internal raw screenshot prime to wake the page |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| `highlight_elements` | Yes | Visual overlay for element selection |
| `click_element` | Yes | Verify interaction result |
| `hover_element` | Yes | Verify hover state |
| `scroll_element` | Yes | Verify scroll position |
| `keyboard_input` | Yes | Verify input result |
| `handle_dialog` | Yes | Verify dialog handling result |
| `screenshot` | Yes | Explicit screenshot request |

### Commands That Do NOT Return Screenshots

| Command | Behavior | How to Get Screenshot |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| `tab list` | Returns tab list only | N/A |
| `tab close` | Returns close result only | N/A |
| `javascript_execute` | Returns JS result only | Call `screenshot` after |

### Best Practice

When you need visual feedback after JavaScript execution:
```
1. javascript_execute "document.querySelector('#button').click()"  # No screenshot
2. screenshot                                                # Explicit request for visual feedback
```
1. tab init https://example.com    # No screenshot
2. screenshot                      # Explicit request for visual feedback
3. highlight_elements()            # Get interactive elements
```

This explicit approach gives the AI full control over when visual feedback is needed.

- **Time limits**: Configurable per test case (`time_limit` in seconds, default: 600)
- **Cost limits**: Configurable per test case (`cost_limit` in RMB, default: 1.0)

#### 3. Enhanced Output Organization
```
output/
└── YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/           # Timestamped run directory
    ├── dashscope_qwen3.5-plus/    # Model-specific subdirectory
    │   ├── images/            # Screenshots
    │   ├── events/            # SSE events (JSON, images removed)
    │   └── evaluation_report_...json

    │   └── evaluation_report_...json
    ├── cross_model_summary.json   # Cross-model comparison
    └── evaluation_report_...json  # Overall report
```

#### 4. Cost Tracking and Currency Conversion
- **Usage metrics**: Extracts cost from `usage_metrics` SSE events
- **Currency conversion**: Automatically converts USD to RMB (exchange rate: 7)
- **DashScope models**: Costs already in RMB, no conversion needed
- **Cost extraction**: Handles both `model_name` and token usage model fields

#### 5. Context Window Tracking
- **Context window size**: Included in `usage_metrics` events as top-level `context_window` field
- **Source**: Extracted from LLM configuration (`max_input_tokens`) or accumulated token usage
- **Value**: Represents the total context window size of the model (maximum input tokens), not current usage
- **Availability**: Always present (defaults to 0 if not available)

#### 6. SSE Event Recording
- **Complete event log**: All SSE events saved to JSON files (excluding image data)
- **Image data removed**: Base64 image data replaced with `[IMAGE_DATA_REMOVED]`
- **Event structure**: Preserves event types, timestamps, and metadata

### Usage
```bash
# List available tests
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --list

# Automated eval requires a browser UUID capability token
export OPENBROWSER_CHROME_UUID=YOUR_BROWSER_UUID

# Run single test with default models
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --test techforum

# Run all tests with specific models
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --model dashscope/qwen3.5-plus --model dashscope/qwen3.5-flash

# Or pass the UUID explicitly
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --test techforum --chrome-uuid YOUR_BROWSER_UUID

# Run without starting services
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --no-services

# Run with custom time/cost limits in test case YAML
# Add to YAML: time_limit: 300 (5 minutes), cost_limit: 5.0 (5 RMB)
```

Notes:
- `--chrome-uuid` is required for automated runs that actually drive a browser
- `--manual` and `--list` do not require a browser UUID
- `OPENBROWSER_CHROME_UUID` is the equivalent environment variable for scripts and CI

### Manual Mode
When using a single test (`--test`), add `--manual` option for human-in-the-loop testing. In manual mode:
1. Test instructions are displayed on screen (exactly the same as given to OpenBrowser)
2. Human tester performs the complete task based on the instruction (no step-by-step guidance)
3. After completing the task, human enters "ok" to indicate completion
4. Scoring is displayed (efficiency and task scores given normally, usage score skipped)
5. Track events are saved from the moment instruction is displayed (same timing as automated test)

```bash
# Run manual test
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --test gbr --manual

# Manual mode with no services (eval server must be running for tracking)
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --test techforum --manual --no-services

# Run ALL tests in manual mode (no --test parameter)
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --manual

# Manual mode all tests with no services
python eval/evaluate_browser_agent.py --manual --no-services
```

#### Manual All-Tests Mode Features
When running all tests in manual mode (`--manual` without `--test`):
1. All available tests are executed sequentially
2. Each test starts when tester confirms ready after seeing start URL
3. Timing begins when instruction is displayed (after start URL confirmation)
4. Comprehensive summary report generated at the end (manual_summary.json)
5. Similar report format to automated tests but without usage scores
6. Includes per-test details and overall statistics
7. Track events saved for each test separately

### API Enhancements for Model Support

#### Conversation Creation with Model Parameter
```python
# Agent Manager API
agent_manager.create_conversation(
    conversation_id="...", 
    cwd=".", 
    model="dashscope/qwen3.5-plus",
    base_url=None,  # Optional override
    browser_id="copied-from-extension-uuid-page",  # Optional capability token
)

# REST API
POST /agent/conversations
{
    "cwd": ".",
    "model": "dashscope/qwen3.5-plus",
    "base_url": "https://api.example.com",
    "browser_id": "copied-from-extension-uuid-page"
}
```

For actual browser control, message POSTs to `/agent/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages` must include `browser_id` unless the conversation metadata is already bound to that UUID.

#### Model Persistence
- **Session metadata**: Model stored in `metadata["model"]` field
- **Consistent usage**: Conversation always uses the same model it was created with
- **Database storage**: SQLite sessions table stores metadata as JSON

### Test Case Definition
Tests are defined in YAML format with:
- `id`, `name`, `description`, `difficulty`
- `start_url`: Initial URL to load
- `instruction`: Task description for AI agent
- `criteria`: List of scoring criteria with expected event patterns
- `time_limit`: Maximum allowed time in seconds (default: 600)
- `cost_limit`: Maximum allowed cost in RMB (default: 1.0)

#### Event Matching Notes
- **Standard events**: `page_view`, `click`, `input`, `submit`, `hover`, `scroll`, `answer_action`
- **Special event types**: 
  - `count_min`: Count-based condition (e.g., `condition: "chat_interactions"`, `count: 3`)
- **Reserved fields**: `event_type`, `page`, `page_contains`, `element_id`, `element_class`, `element_text`, `element_href`, `value_contains`, `value_length_min`, `condition`, `count`
- **Not yet implemented**: Sequence-based `check` conditions (e.g., `after_greeting`, `previous_page_was_search`)

### Event Tracking
Mock websites include tracking JavaScript (`js/tracker.js`) that sends events to `/api/track`. Events include:
- `page_view`, `click`, `input`, `scroll`, `hover`, `submit`, `select`
- Custom event types for specific interactions (e.g., `answer_action` for upvotes)

**IMPORTANT: Shared Tracker Requirement**
- All evaluation websites MUST use the shared `eval/js/tracker.js` library
- Each site initializes the tracker: `window.tracker = new AgentTracker('site_name', 'difficulty')`
- Custom events are tracked via `window.tracker.track('event_type', { ...data })`
- DO NOT create duplicate tracker files or custom tracker implementations
- Standard events (click, input, select, etc.) are automatically tracked by the shared library

### Evaluation Criteria
Criteria match tracked events using flexible pattern matching:
- Event type, element IDs, classes, text content
- Page URLs, input values, custom fields
- Alternative conditions for flexible scoring

### Deferred Prompt And Observation Follow-Ups
- Observation design: add structured geometry hints such as `partly_visible`, `near_viewport_edge`, `occluded_by_sticky_ui`, explicit scroll-container identity, and structured stale-element causes before expanding prompt text again.
- Prompt compaction: after geometry-focused eval results stabilize, reduce duplicated rules between the SDK system prompt and tool prompts so tool templates keep only tool-local contracts and recovery guidance.

## NOTES

- **Vendored SDK:** `openhands-sdk` and `openhands-tools` are editable installs from `../agent-sdk/openhands-sdk` and `../agent-sdk/openhands-tools` (see `[tool.uv.sources]` in `pyproject.toml`). Modify those paths directly when adding agents or tools — there is no separate package to publish.
- **CDP required:** Extension uses Chrome DevTools Protocol for screenshots/JS execution
- **Preset coordinates:** Screenshots at 1280x720, mouse in 0-1280/0-720 coordinate system
- **Config storage:** LLM config in `~/.openbrowser/llm_config.json`
- **Compiler agent traces:** dumped on completion / asking / error to `~/.openbrowser/compiler_traces/{recording_id}_{timestamp}.json`. The path is included in the SSE `complete` / `error` payload from `POST /recordings/{id}/compile`. The compiler agent's `QueueVisualizer` intentionally does not pass a `conversation_id`, so debugging relies on these dump files rather than the sessions DB.
