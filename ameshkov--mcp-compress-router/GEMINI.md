> MCP Compress Router — a single-router MCP server that compresses all

# AGENTS.md

MCP Compress Router — a single-router MCP server that compresses all
connected MCP servers into one, with just two tools: `get_tool_schema` and
`invoke_tool`. Saves up to 99% on token overhead by replacing verbose
tool listings with a compact routing layer.

## Project Overview

A single MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that acts as a router. Instead
of sending all tool names and descriptions from every connected MCP to the
LLM on every request, this server exposes only two tools:

- **`get_tool_schema`** — returns the JSON parameter schema for one or more
  tools on a connected MCP server.
- **`invoke_tool`** — forwards a tool invocation to a connected MCP server
  and returns the result.

The LLM first calls `get_tool_schema` to learn the parameters, then calls
`invoke_tool` to execute. This reduces token overhead by ~96% for a typical
coding session with 3 MCP servers.

## Contribution Instructions

You MUST follow the following rules for EVERY task that you perform:

- You MUST verify it with linter, formatter, and TypeScript compiler.

  Use the following commands:
    - `pnpm typecheck` to check for TypeScript type errors
    - `pnpm lint` to run the linter (oxlint) and Knip unused-export
      analysis
    - `pnpm lint:fix` to fix linting issues that can be fixed
      automatically
    - `pnpm format:check` to check the formatting (Prettier and Markdownlint)
    - `pnpm format:fix` to fix the formatting issues

- When making changes to the project structure, ensure the Project
  Structure section in `AGENTS.md` is updated and remains valid.

- If the prompt essentially asks you to refactor or improve existing code,
  check if you can phrase it as a code guideline. If it's possible, add it
  to the relevant Code Guidelines section in `AGENTS.md`.

- You MUST update the unit tests for changed code.

- You MUST run tests with the `pnpm test` script to verify that your
  changes do not break existing functionality.

- After completing the task you MUST verify that the code you've written
  follows the Code Guidelines in this file.

- When the coding task is finished update `CHANGELOG.md` and explain
  changes in the Unreleased section. Add entries to the appropriate
  subsection (Added, Changed, or Fixed) if it already exists; do not
  create duplicate subsections.

## Code Guidelines

### Architecture

Universal design principles this codebase follows:

- **Separation of Concerns** — each module handles one aspect of the
  system (e.g., `services/` for business logic, `utils/` for shared
  helpers).
- **Single Responsibility Principle** — every file, class, or function has
  one reason to change.
- **Dependency Direction** — dependencies point downward; never from lower
  layers to higher ones.
- **Explicit Boundaries** — module interfaces are intentional; barrel
  `index.ts` files define public API. External code MUST import from
  barrel files only. Each directory groups related functionality and
  imports only from layers below it.
- **Data Flow Clarity** — data moves through the system in a predictable,
  traceable path (entry point → tool handler → service → utility).
- **Minimize Coupling, Maximize Cohesion** — modules are self-contained
  and interact through narrow interfaces.
- **Make Invalid States Impossible** — use TypeScript strict mode and
  validation to prevent illegal combinations at compile time.
- **Bounded Startup Latency** — network-bound startup phases (e.g.
  downstream connects and OAuth metadata probes) MUST run concurrently,
  never stacked sequentially, and each default timeout MUST stay well
  below the host's startup budget (typically 30 s) so a hung downstream
  dependency degrades fast instead of blocking initialization.
- **Keep It Boring** — prefer well-understood patterns over clever or
  novel solutions.

The easiest way to achieve these principles is **layered architecture**.
This project's layers, from top to bottom:

- **Entry point** (`src/index.ts`) — initializes the MCP server, wires
  dependencies, registers tool handlers, and starts the stdio transport.
- **Tool handlers** (`src/tools/`) — MCP tool implementations. Parse
  tool parameters, delegate to core services, and format responses. No
  business logic here.
- **Core services** (`src/services/`) — own all business logic: catalog
  building, downstream server connection and discovery, configuration
  loading.
- **Utilities** (`src/utils/`) — shared helpers, renderers, and type
  definitions. No business logic.

```text
Entry point (index.ts)
     ↓
Tool handlers (tools/)
     ↓
Core services (services/)
     ↓
Utilities (utils/)
```

Tool handlers may call core services. Core services may use utilities.
No layer may depend on a layer above it.

**Tool handlers receive only the catalog**: The entry point creates the
catalog from discovered servers and injects it into tool handlers. Tool
handlers MUST NOT receive transport clients, raw server connections, or
configuration objects. These are implementation details wired inside the
entry point.

**Own your process lifecycle**: The long-running router entry point is
responsible for shutting itself down, not the host. The host may close
the router's stdin pipe without sending a signal (the most common case)
or send `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP`; the MCP SDK's stdio server transport
does NOT listen for stdin EOF, so the router would otherwise linger as a
ghost process forever while spawned downstream servers (and their own
child processes, e.g. browser processes forked by a downstream server)
keep the event loop alive. Therefore the router entry point MUST wire a
`ShutdownCoordinator` that registers cleanup hooks for every spawned
resource (each `ServerConnection`, the MCP server), install
`installShutdownTriggers` to trip the coordinator on signal or stdin EOF,
await `whenShutdown()` so the process stays alive while serving and exits
the moment cleanup finishes, and force-exit (`process.exit`) afterwards
so lingering grandchild pipes cannot trap it. Any new long-running entry
path or spawned resource MUST register a cleanup hook.

### Code Quality

All code MUST meet documentation and style requirements before merge:

- **Public API documentation**: Exported functions, classes, interfaces,
  and their properties MUST have JSDoc comments describing purpose,
  arguments, return values, and thrown errors (use `@throws` only for
  specific errors).
- **Static analysis gates**: Every change MUST pass TypeScript compilation
  (`pnpm typecheck`), oxlint (`pnpm lint`), and Prettier/Markdownlint
  (`pnpm format:check`) before merge.
- **Do not modify linter or formatter configurations**: Never change
  oxlint, Prettier, Markdownlint, or TypeScript configuration files
  (`oxlint.config.ts`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`,
  `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`) to work around lint or
  formatting errors. Fix the source code instead. If the issue cannot be
  resolved after a few attempts, ask the human for help.
- **oxlint category selection**: oxlint groups rules into categories
  rather than a single `recommended` preset. This project enables only the
  `correctness` category (error) plus explicit project rules
  (`no-unused-vars`, `max-lines`, `max-lines-per-function`,
  `preserve-caught-error`). The `suspicious`, `restriction`, `pedantic`,
  and `style` categories, and the `unicorn` plugin, are intentionally
  disabled: they forbid idiomatic TypeScript (async/await, optional
  chaining, object spread, `undefined`) and the project's `_`-prefixed
  private-field convention — none of which the previous ESLint setup
  enforced. Do not re-enable these without explicit justification.
- **Error handling strategy**: Prefer throwing errors over returning error
  values. Handle errors at top-level entry points where they can be logged.
- **Import style**: Use top-level static `import` statements exclusively.
  Do NOT scatter dynamic `await import()` calls inside function bodies
  ("inline imports"). Dynamic imports placed mid-function obscure
  dependencies, bypass static analysis, and fragment module initialization
  across call sites. When a dynamic import is genuinely necessary (e.g.,
  breaking a circular dependency or deferring a heavy module load for
  startup performance), extract it into a named, cached helper function at
  module scope (e.g., `getSdkAuth()`) rather than invoking `await import()`
  inline within business logic.
- **File naming**: Use kebab-case for all file names. TypeScript source
  files MUST use lower-case kebab-case. Do NOT use PascalCase or camelCase
  file names.
- **Knip unused-export analysis**: The project uses Knip
  (`knip.config.ts`) to detect unused exports. All Knip findings MUST
  be resolved — either remove the unused export or, when the export is
  genuinely needed but not reachable through the public dependency
  graph, mark it with the JSDoc `@internal` tag. The `@internal` tag
  is allowed **only** when a symbol is exported solely for test files
  and is intentionally **not** re-exported from the module barrel.
  Every `@internal` tag MUST include a short explanation of why the
  export is excluded (e.g., "Exported for tests only; not part of the
  public module API"). Do NOT use `@internal` to silence legitimate
  unused-export warnings — remove the export instead.
- **No `@public` tag**: Do NOT use the `@public` JSDoc tag. This
  project is an application (not a library), so no symbol is part of a
  "public API" consumed by external consumers. Resolve Knip
  unused-export findings by removing the export or marking it
  `@internal` (for test-only symbols not re-exported from the barrel)
  instead.
- **File size limit**: Source files MUST stay within 300 lines of code.
  This is an enforced oxlint `max-lines` gate (`'error'` severity,
  `max: 300`; blank lines and comments are skipped) — a hard gate, not a
  soft target. When a file approaches or exceeds this limit, your FIRST
  and default response MUST be
  to **split the file into several smaller, cohesive files**, each with a
  single, clear responsibility (extract related functions, types, or
  constants into dedicated modules, utilities, or services, and
  re-export them through the barrel). Treat the limit as a signal that
  the file is doing too much, not as a quota to optimize against. You
  MUST attempt a split before any other tactic; only fall back if you can
  articulate a concrete reason a split would hurt clarity.
  For test files, the `max-lines` gate is raised to 500 (and
  `max-lines-per-function` is disabled); split a large `*.test.ts` into
  multiple focused `*.test.ts` files grouped by the behavior they
  verify — multiple test files per source module are explicitly allowed.
  **Do NOT** satisfy the limit by making the existing code shorter: no
  condensing tests into table-driven blocks purely to save lines, no shortening
  of identifiers, string literals, or file paths, no merging statements onto one
  line, and no removing blank lines, comments, or JSDoc. Formatting is managed
  by Prettier and must stay uniform — readability and clarity always win over
  line count.
  Exceptions: auto-generated files and database migration files.
- **Function size limit**: Functions SHOULD stay within 50 lines of code.
  When approaching or exceeding this limit, break the function into
  smaller, named helper functions with single, clear responsibilities.
  **Do NOT** condense logic into dense one-liners, inline multiple
  statements on a single line, or strip whitespace to fit the limit —
  formatting is managed by Prettier and must not be sacrificed for
  brevity.
  Exceptions: auto-generated files and database migration files.

**Rationale**: Consistent documentation and tooling enforcement prevents
technical debt accumulation and ensures codebase navigability.

### Testing

Every module MUST have test coverage:

- **Test file placement**: Test files are co-located with their source
  files in `src/` and MUST use the `.test.ts` suffix (e.g.,
  `src/config.test.ts` next to `src/config.ts`).
- **Shared test utilities**: Common test infrastructure lives in the
  `test/` directory (fixture servers, setup helpers). These files MUST
  NOT use the `.test.ts` suffix — they are test support code, not test
  cases.
- **End-to-end tests**: E2E tests live in `test/e2e/`. They exercise
  the full compiled router as a child process over stdio using the MCP
  JSON-RPC protocol.
- **Test verification mandatory**: All changes MUST pass `pnpm test`
  before merge. Tests MUST NOT be deleted or weakened without explicit
  justification.
- **Use real integrations where practical**: Integration and E2E tests
  use a fixture MCP server (`test/fixture-server.ts`) that simulates a
  real downstream MCP server over stdio transport. Prefer
  integration-style tests that exercise real components over
  mock-heavy unit tests.

**Rationale**: Co-locating tests with source keeps related files close,
making it easier to find, update, and maintain tests. Testing against
real components catches bugs that mocks hide (transport issues, protocol
mismatches, serialization errors) and gives higher confidence in the
system's actual behavior.

### Dependency Management

- **Pin all dependency versions explicitly**: Do not use `^` or `~` in
  `package.json`.

External dependencies MUST be carefully evaluated before adoption:

- **Prefer vanilla solutions**: Use Node.js built-in APIs and standard
  language features when they adequately solve the problem. Only add a
  dependency when it provides significant value over a vanilla
  implementation.
- **Reputable sources only**: Dependencies MUST come from
  well-established, actively maintained projects. Evaluate by: weekly
  downloads (prefer >100k), GitHub stars, recent commit activity, and
  known maintainers.
- **Avoid unpopular libraries**: Do NOT add niche or obscure packages
  with limited community adoption. These pose security risks and may
  become unmaintained.
- **Minimize dependency count**: Each new dependency increases attack
  surface, bundle size, and maintenance burden. Justify every addition.
- **Use the latest stable version**: When adding a new dependency,
  explicitly check the package registry for the latest stable release and
  use it. Do not copy outdated version numbers from memory, training
  data, or existing lock files of other projects.

**Rationale**: Fewer, well-vetted dependencies reduce security
vulnerabilities, supply chain risks, and long-term maintenance costs.

### Configuration & Documentation

Configuration and documentation MUST stay synchronized with code:

- **Documentation updates required**: Changes to build process or
  configuration MUST update relevant documentation.
- **Structure tracking**: Changes to project structure MUST update the
  Project Structure section in `AGENTS.md`.
- **JSONC config support**: Configuration files support JSONC (comments
  and trailing commas). Use `.jsonc` extension for hand-edited configs.
  CLI management commands write plain `.json` (comments cannot
  round-trip). A `.env` file in cwd is auto-loaded at startup — secrets
  should go there, not in the config file.

**Rationale**: Stale documentation causes onboarding friction and
operational incidents.

### Markdown Formatting

All Markdown files MUST follow these formatting rules:

- **Line length**: Keep lines at most 80 characters. This is not a hard
  lint gate, but SHOULD be followed for readability. Lines inside fenced
  code blocks are exempt from this limit.
- **Unordered lists**: Use dashes (`-`) for bullet points. Indent nested
  list items by 4 spaces.
- **Emphasis**: Use asterisks (`*`) for emphasis (`*italic*`,
  `**bold**`). Do NOT use underscores.
- **Headings**: Duplicate heading names are allowed only among sibling
  headings (same parent level). Avoid duplicates across different levels.
- **Inline HTML**: Avoid raw HTML in Markdown. The only allowed elements
  are `<a>`, `<p>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`, and `<img>`.
- **Trailing spaces**: Do NOT leave trailing whitespace on any line. Do
  NOT use two-space line breaks — use a blank line instead.
- **Bare URLs**: Bare URLs are permitted and do not need to be wrapped
  in angle brackets.
- **Table formatting**: Align table columns with padding when the table
  fits within 80 characters. If the table exceeds 80 characters or
  triggers an MD060 linter warning, switch to a compact format using
  single spaces only. This applies to the separator row as well — it
  should be written as `| --- |`, not `|--|`.

  Example of correct layout:

  ```markdown
  | Col1 | Col2 |
  | --- | --- |
  | Value1 | Value2 |
  ```

  Do NOT use extra padding or alignment characters beyond single spaces.

**Rationale**: Uniform Markdown formatting improves readability for both
humans and AI agents that consume project documentation.
