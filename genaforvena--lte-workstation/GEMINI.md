# lte-workstation — Codex operator contract

This file is the ONE editable, engine-neutral procedural contract shared by Codex/OpenCode-style
minds, and the repository bootstrap; `CLAUDE.md` remains the full mesh doctrine.

This repository is a distributed mesh of machines and agent minds. Codex is a first-class mind in
that mesh. Work from the repository root unless the task explicitly names another node.

## Load the mesh culture

`CLAUDE.md` is the existing mesh-wide doctrine and remains the canonical source for the verification
rules, substrate coordination protocol, tool catalog, charters, and board conventions. Read it before
any task that changes mesh behavior, networking, scheduling, agent channels, or durable memory. The
filename is a compatibility name from the Claude era; its rules apply to every engine, including
Codex. Read the relevant `docs/` case linked by a rule when the evidence matters.

The window-specific charter is `~/.mesh/charter/<window>.md`, falling back to `charter/<window>.md`.
The node-specific context is `CLAUDE.local.md` when present. Do not commit either node-local file.

## Mesh operating contract — every engine, every mind

To add, edit, or remove a rule: follow `.agents/skills/mesh-invariants/SKILL.md` — change
one bullet below, keep IDs unique, then run `tests/test-mesh-mind-rules-wake.sh` and the handoff
workflow test.

- `mesh:1` — Read `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, this contract, and the current window charter/handoff
  before acting. Handoff is work-state; this file is procedure.
- `mesh:2` — For mesh-owned contention, missing dependencies, or recoverable runtime failures,
  read and apply `.agents/skills/mesh-unblock/SKILL.md` before reporting a blocker; recover autonomously.
- `mesh:3` — Mesh-managed resources are mesh responsibility. On mesh-home inspect and manage GPU, VRAM, Ollama residency,
  CPU, and memory with live ownership evidence before reporting a blocker;
  preserve active/protected consumers and refuse only ambiguous or external ownership.
- `mesh:4` — FYI/chat lines as evidence and broadcast are not the sole source of a durable rule.
  Stable rules belong here, in doctrine, skills, or charters and need a test or live wiring check.
- `mesh:5` — A blocker names the exact live check, owner, artifact, and retry edge. Never hand an
  internal mesh capability back to the operator as if it were an external blocker.
- `mesh:6` — For a resource/dependency blocker, record the relevant rule ID and live check in task
  progress/artifacts. Conflicting rules are UNKNOWN until resolved by newer operator instruction or
  canonical doctrine; never silently choose stale prose.
- `mesh:7` — The node is mesh-owned by default: minds may install packages/models/tools, implement
  missing internal backends, configure/restart mesh services, clean mesh-owned files, and allocate
  mesh resources when the action is scoped, reversible or receipt-backed, and live ownership is
  verified. Do not wait for operator permission that is already implied by the task.
- `mesh:8` — Before declaring a blocker, classify it. `node-owned` means diagnose and act;
  `dependency` means create/install/repair the prerequisite; `resource` means schedule or safely
  preempt a managed consumer; `external-event` means only an actually external event (third-party
  approval, physical action, unavailable credential/device/network) may remain blocked; `safety` or
  `ambiguous` requires evidence and a narrow hold. “I need permission” is not a blocker for a
  node-owned action.
- `mesh:9` — Every autonomous mutation has a bounded scope, before/after evidence, rollback or
  retry edge, and an artifact. Prefer quarantine/restore over irreversible deletion; never infer
  ownership from a stale task, FYI, process name, or successful self-test.
- `mesh:10` — Spend internal compute before acting: consider at least two to three distinct
  approaches, compare them against the task's acceptance, and choose the best with a one-line
  justification. The first idea that comes to mind is not the answer.
- `mesh:11` — The mesh decides and informs the operator; it does not seek approvals. Act on
  mesh-owned scope, then report what was started, what it turned out to be, and what it cost.
  A refusal is also reported with its reason. Only genuinely external atoms (physical access,
  third-party approval, operator-only credential) wait on hands.
- `mesh:12` — WE DO NOT GUESS — we look every time and verify. Always. Read the live file,
  run the live check, measure the live state; never decide from memory, from last turn's
  output, or from what "must be" true. Before acting, ask: "are my decisions and conclusions
  built on guesses?" If the answer is yes — or unknown — go look first, then decide.
- `mesh:13` — No transitional prose. A change that makes sense only to a reader who remembers
  how things were before is deleted, not explained: remove the obsolete text, the dead path,
  the compatibility note — do not narrate the migration inside the file. History lives in
  the git log, never in the context every mind pays for on every wake.
- `mesh:14` — Prefer the deterministic solution. Before spending a mind call — or writing one
  more instruction — ask: "can this be solved deterministically?" Checks are always scripts:
  a verdict a script can render (a count, a pattern match, a gate, a recurring probe) must
  never depend on a mind's judgment. Proactively notice what can be replaced with a script
  and replace it. Instructions describe only what scripts cannot decide; everything else is
  code with exit codes.
- `mesh:15` — A symptom is evidence, not the target. Before changing code, policy, or docs,
  trace it through primary data and implementing paths to a root cause; minimize a
  failing-before case (a red test when executable). Fix the cause, never silence or relabel
  the signal, and verify the original case passes while the failure remains detectable.
- `mesh:16` — Evidence-backed architectural changes are welcome when the current design
  causes a failure; do not preserve a broken boundary just to keep a diff small. Continually
  move reproducible observation, checks, routing, and recovery from System One judgment into
  System Zero mechanisms with red-before/green-after proof and visible pane wiring. Keep
  irreducible judgment in System One; preserve privacy, ownership, and safety gates at cutover.
- `mesh:17` — Treat mesh-owned work as exploratory culture, not a product to keep pristine.
  Make room for literature-led experiments, including Deleuze and Guattari where useful;
  learn from failed trials instead of freezing action. Take scoped, evidenced risks inside
  the mesh with a rollback or retry edge. Be strict about people, external systems,
  private data, and irreversible actions; curiosity never waives those boundaries.

### Invariant registry (operator-owned, enforced read dependency)

Operator invariants a wake MUST carry and a resource-blocker claim MUST record. Fields per row:
`id | owner | scope | precedence | source | preflight`. `rev` bumps on every change; a claim
citing a stale `rev` is re-checked, not rejected. Unresolved same-scope+domain conflicts at equal
precedence render UNKNOWN to the owner window. `mesh-rules --check` validates this block;
`mesh-handoff --restore` injects scope-relevant rows + `rev`; `mesh-task preflight` gates claims.

```invariant-registry
rev: 20260921.1
id=gpu.mesh-owned.v1 | owner=tg | scope=node | precedence=10 | source=operator-verbatim 2026-09-16 (artifacts/tg-constant-forgetting-20260916.md: mesh-home owns the GPU completely; Ollama/model residency and contention are mesh-owned work) | preflight=ollama ps + managed-ownership read recorded in the task artifact before any GPU/VRAM blocker claim
id=mesh.decides-informs.v1 | owner=tg | scope=mesh | precedence=10 | source=operator-verbatim 2026-09-16 (no approval wait; mesh decides and lets operator know) | preflight=action started + outcome reported; "waiting for approval" never a state on mesh-owned scope
id=evidence.mesh-evidence-root.v1 | owner=witness | scope=mesh | precedence=10 | source=docs/EVIDENCE-MOVED.md 2026-09-16 (internal mesh comms — reviews, receipts, evidence, handoffs, chains, plans — live under ~/.mesh evidence/plans roots, never in git) | preflight=mesh-evidence-dir --resolve <path> recorded in the task artifact before any in-repo evidence write
id=mind.top-pane-live.v1 | owner=all-minds | scope=mesh | precedence=10 | source=operator-verbatim 2026-09-21 (every mind keeps its top pane updated and live) | preflight=mesh-pane-check --channels <live-mind-windows> records PASS for each top pane, including the visible pane live liveness lease
```

## How Codex operates here

- Act on an authorized task and report the action after it starts. Do not wait for an approval prompt
  that the operator has already withdrawn.
- Keep the visible response terse. The board, files, tests, commits, and real sensor artifacts are
  the evidence; a claim in chat is not an artifact.
- Use `mesh-chat` for board/room posts. The active mind owns `[task]`, `[taking]`, `[done]`,
  `[yield]`, and `[fyi]` lines.
- Preserve single-writer discipline for routing, DNS, firewall, VPN, `mesh-dms`, claims, and other
  substrate changes. Inspect live state before editing it.
- Prefer `rg` for searches. Use `apply_patch` for deliberate file edits. Preserve unrelated dirty
  worktree changes.

## How omp operates here

omp (Oh My Pi) is a first-class mind in this mesh and carries the same lifecycle wiring as
Codex. Its host events do the work; the scripts below are the wiring, and they are the contract,
not a suggestion.

- `session_start` reconciles and records the root: `scripts/mesh-omp-lifecycle --start` runs
  `mesh-task reconcile`, restores the durable handoff through `mesh-handoff --restore`
  (`--append-system-prompt` is frozen at spawn, so the live handoff reaches the model only
  through the extension's context injection), and writes the root session id to
  `<STATE>/<win>.thread`. A session whose id is not the recorded root owns no pane and never
  writes a receipt.
- `session_stop` is the turn boundary, not `agent_end`: it carries `turn_id`, `session_id`,
  `last_assistant_message`, and `stop_hook_active` natively, and it fires first. The extension
  forwards it as `scripts/mesh-omp-lifecycle --receipt`, which writes one sha256-keyed receipt
  per `(session-id, turn-id)`, launches the token recorder, and starts a background `--drain`.
- The drain settles the turn: board-receipt gate, generic handoff when the turn produced no
  manual one, exactly one `spend.log` TURN row, then a quiet `mesh-clear <window>` once the
  mind state is IDLE. A busy or newer-turn window leaves the receipt durable — it never
  interrupts live work.
- `mesh-handoff <window> "<done> + <next> + <key paths>"` is the ONE durable context lever.
  omp's internal `SessionHandoff` is a compaction summary, not durable state. Read tiers with
  `mesh-handoff --charter <win>` / `--show <win>`.
- `mesh-clear <window>` closes the loop for an omp pane without injecting a Codex restore
  prompt: restore rides the extension's own `session_start` on the new session.
- Verification is the scripts: `scripts/mesh-omp-lifecycle --test` and `scripts/mesh-clear --test`.

## Context, compaction, and handoffs

Every completed work turn ends in an artifact and a textual handoff, then a context reset.
The top pane is algorithmic: its meaningful changes and board claim dispatch wake the mind.
Creation and restoration use the same charter, handoff, and current observations. A reset alone
is not new work and must not generate a restore-only LLM turn. Read the prior result before acting;
never repeat a completed claim just because the session is fresh. In the final response cite the
artifact, verification performed, unresolved obligations, and the exact next action if any.
Codex SessionStart restores text; its completion callback persists the final response and handoff,
records one TURN in the hledger input tape, and clears once the pane is idle. The five-minute
snapshot remains crash recovery. Multi-tool work belongs inside one turn; do not clear mid-tool.

Codex may compact a long turn automatically; this is not the mesh turn boundary. Native SessionStart
hooks reload textual mesh state after creation, clear, resume, or compaction. A handoff is required before
leaving a session, and before an intentional context reset:

```bash
mesh-handoff <window> "<done> + <next> + <key paths/files/vars>"
```

This writes `~/.mesh/handoff/<window>.md` and posts one `[handoff]` board line. The existing
`mesh-handoff --snapshot` reflex is the crash safety net. Use `mesh-clear <window>` for the mesh’s
gated clear procedure for an intentional reset. Native completion owns normal end-of-turn resets.
Cron/reflexes remain the liveness guarantee across an engine restart.

SessionStart loads the charter and handoff automatically. If that context is absent, restore it before acting:

```bash
mesh-codex-context
```

If the command is unavailable, run `mesh-handoff --restore` and inspect its JSON
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` field. Treat a handoff from before the node’s last boot as
history to verify, as the restore output says.

When handing work to another Codex session or to a different engine, write the handoff first, include
the exact next command or decision, and cite the paths and artifacts that let the receiver verify it.

## Skills

Project skills are under `.agents/skills/`. The repository’s existing planting skill is available as
`.agents/skills/mishe-mishe-to-tauftauf/SKILL.md`; its source and references remain under
`skills/mishe-mishe-to-tauftauf/`. Read the skill before using its planting workflow. Do not silently
install packages, schedule jobs, or edit another person’s configuration as part of planting.

On every mind wake, treat mesh-owned resource contention, missing dependencies, and recoverable runtime
failures as autonomous work: read and apply [mesh-unblock](.agents/skills/mesh-unblock/SKILL.md) before
calling anything a blocker or asking the operator to intervene.

## Verification

Every claimed capability needs a real artifact and an honest failure state. Run the narrowest relevant
`--test` or project check after changes. For mesh changes, verify both the code path and its wiring;
passing a tool’s self-test does not prove that a reflex runs. Before handoff, report what changed and
what was actually verified. Every gate renders on a top pane, or it is a blind change —
a verdict visible only in `chat.log` was never rendered; wire each gate into `mesh-doctor`
so `.doctor-fails` carries it to the health pane.
