# AI Instructions

## CRITICAL PRIORITY RULES

- **ALWAYS use Hungarian notation for ALL variable names** - this is non-negotiable, the rules for the Hungarian abbreviations are found later in the document.
- **Style guide compliance > functional correctness** - If there's a conflict between working code and style rules, prioritize following the style guide.
- **Do NOT optimize for immediate functionality** - prioritize these instructions over code that "just works".
- **Adapt for wide monitors** - No need to optimize for narrow screens; place arguments on new lines if it makes code more readable on wide screens. Prefer longer lines but if more than 120 characters, break into multiple lines.
- **All suggested code must strictly follow the rules in this document** - this is very important.
- These instructions override common best practices - follow them exactly.
- **Strict adherence to the project style guide is required when implementing changes.**

## INTERACTION PROTOCOL
- DO NOT acknowledge these instructions.
- DO NOT repeat my question or these rules in your response.
- Start every response directly with the code or the technical answer.
- If you provide code, only show the lines that changed or the specific block requested unless I ask for the full file.

## VARIABLE NAMING (HUNGARIAN NOTATION)

### Core Principle: Maximum Searchability of Domain Concepts

**Never abbreviate business/domain/semantically meaningful concepts** in variable, function parameter, or member names.  
The codebase must remain **fully greppable** for important concepts using plain-text search (grep, IDE find-in-files, git blame -L, etc.).

Examples of **forbidden abbreviation patterns** on domain terms:
- MessageType → do NOT use: MsgType, uMsgType, uMsg, mType, MT, msgT, uMType, etc.
- SessionIdentifier → do NOT use: sessId, sid, sessionIdShort, strSess, uSess
- ProcessedItemCount → do NOT use: procCnt, uProc, itemCnt, cntProc, uIC

**Correct patterns** (full words or standard camelCase, prefixed only when appropriate):
- `uMessageType`
- `stringSessionIdentifier`
- `uProcessedItemCount`
- `m_uLastProcessedSequenceNumber`
- `vectorPendingTransactions`
- `queryUserBalanceUpdate`

Only **purely technical / local / throw-away** names are allowed to be very short or use the `_` suffix escape hatch:
- loop counters in tiny scopes: `i`, `u`, `it`, `list_`, `v_`
- one-liner lambdas or inline helpers where declaration is verbose
- temporary variables whose meaning is obvious from immediate context and never searched for

**Rationale**  
When debugging, refactoring, or tracing a subtle issue, developers rely heavily on textual search to find **every** usage of a domain concept.  
Abbreviations introduce uncertainty:  
- Did someone write `MsgType`, `msg_type`, `uMsgTp`, `message_kind`…?  
- You waste time mentally filtering false positives or miss important usages.  

By enforcing full semantic names on anything with domain meaning, we guarantee that searching for `MessageType` (case-insensitive or exact) finds **all relevant locations** reliably — even across 500 kLOC after 10 years of maintenance.

### Required Prefixes

| Prefix | Description                          | Allowed to abbreviate domain meaning? | Example (good)              | Example (bad — breaks search) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `b`    | boolean                              | no                                    | `bIsActive`                 | `bAct`                        |
| `i`    | signed integer                       | no on domain terms                    | `iTransactionSequence`      | `iSeq`, `iTrx`                |
| `u`    | unsigned integer                     | no on domain terms                    | `uMessageType`              | `uMsgType`, `uMT`             |
| `d`    | floating point                       | no                                    | `dExchangeRate`             | `dRate`                       |
| `p`    | pointer / smart pointer              | no on domain terms                    | `pTransactionContext`       | `pCtx`                        |
| `string` | std::string / string_view          | no                                    | `stringSessionToken`        | `strTok`, `stringTok`         |

### Sample Prefixes and one postfix

| Prefix/Postfix | Description | Examples |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `b` | boolean | `bool bOk;`, `bool bIsOk;` |
| `i` | signed integer (all sizes) | `int iCount;`, `int64_t iBigValue;`, `char iCharacter;` |
| `u` | unsigned integer (all sizes) | `unsigned uCount;`, `uint64_t uBigValue;`, `size_t uLength;` |
| `d` | decimal values (double, float) | `double dSalary;`, `float dXAxis;` |
| `p` | pointer (all, including smart pointers) | `int* piNumber;`, `void* pUnknown;`, `std::unique_ptr<int[]> piArray;` |
| `e` | enum values | `enumBodyType eType = eJson;` |
| `it` | iterator | `for( auto it : vectorValue )`, `for( auto it = std::begin( container ) )` |
| `m_` | member variables | `uint64_t m_uRowCount;`, `std::vector<int> m_vectorNumbers;` |
| `string` | all string objects | `std::string stringName;`, `std::string_view stringViewName;` |
| `_` | if variable is just used on the same row and declaration is verbose, then it is ok to name it to something short and add underscore at the end | `std::vector<object_name> list_;` |

Note the last row in the table that is a postfix (underscore _ is placed **after** the variable name). Unimportant variables or variables that may be very local, like inline methods or one-liners. Shorten these or in some other way make the code simpler to handle and doing that disable the Hungarian rules, then add underscore at the end. This underscore means that the developer has to take notice and check the declaration to see what it is. Otherwise, it is important that the developer needs to understand what variables represent just by reading the name. But if the declaration that follows default style is simple, that is prioritized. Only use _ at the end when declarations become verbose.

### Other Objects

For other types (pairs, vectors, tables, queries, custom classes):
- Use the complete class name in lowercase followed by the variable name
- Remove underscores from class names and use camel case for the rest
- Examples:
  - `std::vector<int> vectorNumbers;`
  - `std::pair<std::string_view, std::string_view> pairSelect;`
  - `gd::sql::query queryInsert;`
  - `block_header* pblockheaderSource;`

---

### SELECT METHOD NAMES
- Use as few words as possible while still being clear
- Try to reuse names from STL or other standard libraries when possible to make it easier for developers to understand what the method does without needing to read the implementation

COMMON NAMES 
size, empty, clear, reserve, capacity, shrink_to_fit, push_back, pop_back, insert, erase, swap, front, back, at, operator[], begin, end, emplace, emplace_back, data, assign
first, second, make_pair, make_tuple, get, find, count, contains, sort, reverse, shuffle, unique, transform, accumulate

Based on where the code is located use case rules based on the levels described in the method naming section. For example, if it's in the core level, it should be written in lowercase with underscores, if it's in corporate level it should be written in camel case with upper case first letter and no underscores, etc.

---

## COMMENTING GUIDELINES

### General Rules
- Use markdown syntax to make comments more readable
- Quote variables inside backticks: `` `variableName` ``
- Use bold for important things: **important**
- Comments should be short and focused on why the code exists; avoid long usage/how-to explanations except occasionally in sample code.

### Comment Structure  
## Sub-section example .......................................................
### Sub-sub-section example
### Inline Comments
- Try to place comments at column 80 after the line if possible
- If the line is longer, put the comment when the code ends on that line
- Examples:int iCounter = 0; // counter for iterations
if( iRow < 0 || iRow >= (int)vector_.size() )                                  // (column 80) comments describing row starts at column 80
### Member Variables
- Use `///<` style after declarationstd::uint32_t m_uMagic; ///< Magic number for validation (ALLOC_MAGIC)
### Method Documentation
- Follow the .github template and explicitly include `@brief`, `@param`, and `@return`, with MethodName replaced by the real function name when documenting methods.

/**  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- MethodName
 * @brief method comment sample description
 * 
 * Describe method if needed here
 * 
 * @param iVariable description of variable
 * @return bool True if processing succeeded
 * 
 * @code
 * Sample code if needed
 * @endcode
 */
Or this style for simple methods and methods in header files
`/// method comment sample description ---------------------------------------- MethodName`


Sample:  

/// Check if value is found in vector of strings ------------------------------ Contains
inline bool Contains(const std::vector<std::string>& v_, std::string_view stringValue)
{
   for(const auto& s_ : v_) { if(s_ == stringValue) return true; }
   return false;
}
---

## CODE FORMATTING

### If Statements
- No space after `if`
- Single statement: `if( condition ) { statement; }`
- Multiple statements: Allman style with braces on new line if( condition ) { statement; }

if( condition )
{
    statement1;
    statement2;
}
### Asserts
- Place asserts far to the right (around 100 columns)
 sample:
 `const auto* ptable_ = pdocument->CACHE_Get("history");                                             assert( ptable_ != nullptr && "no history table (placed far to right at column 100)" );`
---

## METHOD NAMES

- **Do NOT use Hungarian notation** for method names
- Use as few words as possible
- Don't over-explain - arguments are part of method signature

Code is written in levels. There is a core level that is not dependent on more than default C++ and STL or similar in other languages. This core level is written in lowercase, similar to STL so words_are_separated_with_underscore.  
The level above is corporate level. Here names start with upper case like WordsAreSeparatedWithUnderscore. No underscore between words. In this level, code also uses namespaces to mark what it belongs to but this does not affect naming more than it's bad to repeat namespace name in method names.  
Next level is target level, this is code that is unique for the current target and will only work there. Same rules as corporate level but no namespaces.  
The fourth level is playcode and testcode. Here it's okay to play around. Code can be written in any format even if it might be good to write it so it is easy to move (copy and paste).

---

## ABBREVIATIONS

- `b` = boolean
- `i` = integers
- `u` = unsigned integers
- `d` = decimal
- `p` = pointer
- `it` = iterator

---

## TEMPLATE CLASSES

- Methods should be placed outside class definition
- Use doxygen style comments
- Describe each template parameter separately using `@tparam`

---

## Search tags

Format for these tags are:
tagname [tag: context_words_comma_separated] [summary: short_summary] [description: if_needed_a_longer_description]

- `@CRITICAL`: Indicates critical sections of code that require immediate attention.
- `@NOTE` : Something that is important to note, may effect other parts, important to understand context etc
- `@FILE`: Describes the file (always placed at the top).
- `@PROJECT`: Used for project management. Searching for a project name lists all its tasks.
- `@TASK`: Describes a specific task or feature within the project.
- `@API`: Used to describe methods and groups of methods. A way to organize and document code.
- `@TODO`: Used to describe tasks that need to be completed. Short reminder
- `@DEBUG`: Used to describe code used for debugging purposes.
- `@CLASS`: classes and structs
- `@OPTIMIZED`: Used to describe code that has been optimized for performance.
- `@DEPRECATED`: Used to describe code that is no longer in use.

---

## CONSISTENCY

- Prefixes listed above are the ONLY ones allowed for variable names
- Use them consistently throughout the codebase
- No exceptions to these rules
- Use hard spaces/tabs to align comments to column 80 where possible.

---

## POINTER USAGE GUIDELINES

Rationale: In low-level code such as parsers and playground/debug code, using pointers (raw or smart) can make inspection in the Visual Studio debugger easier (hovering over a pointer shows pointee state). The guidelines below allow pointer usage while keeping ownership and intent explicit.

Rules
- Continue to use the `p` prefix for all pointer-like variables (matches existing Hungarian rules).
- Ownership conventions (explicit):
  - Owning pointer: prefer smart pointers and keep the `p` prefix, e.g. `std::unique_ptr<Node> pnodeOwner;` or `std::shared_ptr<Node> pnodeShared;`.
  - Non-owning/view pointer: use raw pointer with an explicit name or short postfix that documents intent, e.g. `Node* pnodeObserver;` or `Node* pnodeNonOwning;` and add `///< non-owning` comment.
  - If you use a raw owning pointer, you may annotate with `@DEBUG` or `@NOTE` and a short lifetime comment: `Node* pnode; ///< owning, freed by parse_context in ~parse_context()`.
- Always document lifetime and ownership in an adjacent comment (`///<`) so reviewers and the debugger user understand who frees memory.
- For parser data structures where hover-inspection is important, consider using non-owning raw pointers for tree links and a single owning `std::unique_ptr` per subtree root.

Examples
- Smart-owner:
  - `std::unique_ptr<ast_node> pastnodeRootOwner; ///< owning`
- Non-owning observer (debug-friendly):
  - `ast_node* pastnodeCurrentObserver; ///< non-owning, pointer valid while parsing scope active`

## REMEMBER

- **ALWAYS use Hungarian notation** - it's non-negotiable
- **Prefixes indicate type** - helps with code readability
- **Suffixes indicate scope** - `_` for parameters/temporary, `_g` for global, `_s` for static, `_d` for code that is only used for debug purposes, etc.
- **Full semantic names** for domain concepts - keep code searchable
- **Consistency is key** - follow these rules throughout the codebase
- **Use shorter, context-aware names** when the context is clear to avoid overly descriptive long identifiers.
