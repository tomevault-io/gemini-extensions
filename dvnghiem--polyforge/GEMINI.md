## polyforge

> Backend engineering command center for polyglot developers — 8 specialized agents, 15 task categories, language-aware routing, research-first workflow, anti-hallucination guardrails, and automated task completion loops for Python, Rust, TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++, and Ruby projects on OpenClaw.


# PolyForge

> Structured, research-first, language-aware backend engineering workflow for OpenClaw.

## Overview

PolyForge provides a 3-layer agent architecture and opinionated workflow for backend engineers working across Python, Rust, TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++, and Ruby. Every task flows through triage → planning → execution → verification.

- **3-Layer Architecture**: Strategy (Atlas) → Coordination (Architect, Researcher, Analyst, Critic, Explorer) → Execution (Sprint, Forge)
- **15 Task Categories**: Intent-based routing from quick fixes to deep research to architecture decisions
- **Language-Aware**: Auto-detects Python / Rust / TypeScript / Go / Java / C++ / Ruby, injects relevant skills and verification rules
- **Research-First**: Evaluate technologies before building via structured Tech Briefs
- **Anti-Hallucination Guardrails**: 8 rules injected into every prompt
- **Autorun Loop**: Self-correcting execution with configurable iteration limits
- **Todo Tracking**: Persistent todo management across sessions via `pf_todo_*` tools

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DVNghiem/PolyForge polyforge
cd polyforge/plugin
npm install
npm run build
npx pf-setup
```

Add to OpenClaw config:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "polyforge": {
      "path": "./polyforge/plugin"
    }
  }
}
```

### Verify Installation

```
/pf status

```

## Trigger

This skill activates when:

- User invokes `/triage`, `/research`, `/intake`, `/plan`, `/execute`, or `/work`
- User asks for task routing, technology evaluation, or backend engineering help
- User needs multi-step coding pipeline coordination across Python, Rust, TypeScript, Go, Java, C/C++, or Ruby

## Architecture

### Layer 1: Strategy

| Agent     | Role                                                              | Categories        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Atlas** | Orchestrator — triage, plan, delegate, verify, escalate           | apex, all routing |

### Layer 2: Coordination

| Agent          | Role                                                             | Category  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Architect**  | Read-only architecture consultation — API design, data models    | apex      |
| **Researcher** | Technology evaluation — produces structured Tech Briefs          | research  |
| **Analyst**    | Gap analysis — finds missing requirements before implementation  | review    |
| **Critic**     | Code & plan review — severity-categorized findings, fix guidance | review    |
| **Explorer**   | Codebase search — maps structure, traces dependencies, finds patterns | quick |

### Layer 3: Execution

| Agent      | Role                                                              | Category              |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Sprint** | Quick worker — bounded features, bug fixes, docs, TypeScript/Ruby work | quick, typescript, ruby, writing |
| **Forge**  | Deep specialist — complex refactors, async debugging, Rust/Python/Go/Java/C++ | deep, rust, python, go, java, cpp |

### Category-to-Agent Routing

| Category         | Default Agent | Examples                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `quick`          | Sprint        | Add a field, fix a typo, rename a function             |
| `deep`           | Forge         | Refactor auth module, implement rate limiter           |
| `apex`           | Architect     | Design a service boundary, evaluate caching strategy   |
| `research`       | Researcher    | Evaluate Axum vs Actix, compare PostgreSQL vs CockroachDB |
| `rust`           | Forge         | Fix lifetime issue, optimize hot path, async trait impl|
| `python`         | Forge         | Add FastAPI endpoint, write async background task      |
| `typescript`     | Sprint        | Add Fastify route, fix type error, write integration test |
| `go`             | Forge         | Add gin handler, fix goroutine leak, write table-driven test |
| `java`           | Forge         | Add Spring Boot endpoint, write JPA repository, fix N+1 |
| `cpp`            | Forge         | Fix memory leak, optimize hot path, write CMakeLists.txt |
| `ruby`           | Sprint        | Add Rails action, write RSpec test, define ActiveRecord scope |
| `review`         | Critic        | Review PR diff, critique a plan, identify security issues |
| `writing`        | Sprint        | Write a tech brief, update API docs, write changelog   |
| `unspecified-low`| Sprint        | Unknown low-complexity tasks                           |

Coding categories (`quick`, `deep`, `rust`, `python`, `typescript`, `go`, `java`, `cpp`, `ruby`) route through `pf_spawn_acp` → `sessions_spawn` for real sub-agent sessions.

## Workflows

### `/work` — Full Engineering Pipeline

1. **Intake** — `pf_intake` parses the task into a Task Brief (scope, category, files, acceptance criteria)
2. **Research** *(conditional)* — Triggered if technology is unknown; Researcher produces a Tech Brief
3. **Plan** — Atlas breaks the brief into ordered subtasks with dependencies
4. **Execute** — Sprint or Forge implement each subtask; `pf_spawn_acp` spawns coding sessions
5. **Review** — Critic reviews the output; Atlas verifies against acceptance criteria
6. **Done** — All todos marked complete; summary reported to user

### `/triage [task]` — Classify and Route

Atlas answers 4 questions and routes to the correct workflow:

| Type          | Workflow    | Lead Agent   |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Research/learn | `/research` | Researcher  |
| Build/implement | `/intake`  | Atlas        |
| Review/critique | `/review`  | Critic       |
| Design/decision | `/brainstorm` | Analyst    |
| Full cycle    | `/work`     | Atlas        |

### `/research [topic]` — Technology Investigation

1. Researcher runs 3-phase methodology: Discovery → Health Assessment → Adoption Signals
2. Produces a structured **Tech Brief** with recommendation and trade-offs
3. Findings feed back into task context for downstream planning

### `/intake [description]` — Structured Task Intake

Converts a raw PM request or issue description into a Task Brief JSON with: scope, acceptance criteria, suggested category, files involved, open questions.

### `/plan [topic]` — Planning Only

Atlas produces a phased execution plan with ordered subtasks, dependencies, and verification steps. Returns plan for user approval before execution.

### `/execute [plan]` — Execute Approved Plan

Atlas distributes approved plan tasks to Sprint or Forge via `pf_delegate`, tracks progress with `pf_todo_*`, and verifies each subtask before marking done.

## Tools

All tools are prefixed `pf_`. Coding tasks flow through `pf_delegate` → `pf_spawn_acp` → `sessions_spawn`.

| Tool               | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pf_delegate`      | Route a task to the correct agent by category             |
| `pf_spawn_acp`     | Spawn a coding sub-agent session with verification loop   |
| `pf_intake`        | Parse task description into a structured Task Brief       |
| `pf_research`      | Initiate a technology research workflow                   |
| `pf_checkpoint`    | Save progress snapshot for recovery                       |
| `pf_search`        | Web search for documentation and resources                |
| `pf_todo_create`   | Create a tracked todo item                                |
| `pf_todo_list`     | List all pending todos                                    |
| `pf_todo_update`   | Update todo status (in-progress / done / blocked)         |

## Guardrails

8 anti-hallucination rules injected into every prompt via `guardrail-injector` hook (priority 100):

1. Never invent file paths — verify they exist before referencing
2. Never assume a function signature — read the source first
3. Never claim tests pass without running them
4. Never use placeholder implementations in production code
5. State uncertainty explicitly rather than guessing
6. Prefer reading existing code over writing from memory
7. Verify library/package versions against the actual lockfile
8. Never skip the verification checklist before marking a task done

## Hook System

Hooks fire automatically during the OpenClaw request lifecycle:

| Priority | Hook                | Event                    | Effect                                              |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 50       | context-injector    | before_prompt_build      | Injects session context and priority queue          |
| 60       | todo-enforcer       | before_prompt_build      | Forces todo continuation directive into prompt      |
| 70       | lang-detector       | before_prompt_build      | Detects language, injects relevant skills           |
| 75       | keyword-detector    | tool_result_persist      | Detects trigger keywords in tool results            |
| 80       | keyword-detector    | before_prompt_build      | Activates skill injection based on detected keywords|
| 100      | guardrail-injector  | before_prompt_build      | Injects 8 anti-hallucination rules                  |
| 150      | spawn-guard         | before_tool_call         | Validates sub-agent spawn parameters                |
| 200      | session-sync        | session_start/session_end| Persists and restores session state                 |

### Todo Enforcer Directive

Injected automatically when incomplete todos are detected:

```
[SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: POLYFORGE — TODO CONTINUATION]
You MUST continue working on incomplete todos.
- Do NOT stop until all tasks are marked complete
- Do NOT ask for permission to continue
- Mark each task complete immediately when finished
- If blocked, document the blocker and move to next task
```

## State Persistence

Plugin state is stored in `.polyforge-state/` at the workspace root:

| File              | Contents                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `persona.json`    | Active agent ID and switch metadata                   |
| `todos.json`      | Persistent todo items with status tracking            |
| `agents.md.bak`   | Backup of original AGENTS.md before persona switch    |

## Commands Reference

| Command            | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
