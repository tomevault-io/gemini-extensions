## What this project is

ToolRegistry is a **protocol-agnostic tool management library** for
function-calling LLMs. It unifies tool registration, schema generation, and
execution across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) and
external ecosystems (MCP, OpenAPI, LangChain).

This is the **core** package in a three-package ecosystem:

| Package | Role | Depends on |
|---------|------|------------|
| `toolregistry` (this) | Core library: `Tool` model, `ToolRegistry`, client integrations | — |
| `toolregistry-server` | Server infrastructure: `RouteTable`, OpenAPI/MCP adapters, auth, CLI | `toolregistry` |
| `toolregistry-hub` | Tool implementations + default server configuration | `toolregistry-server` |

Downstream packages are notified on release via `notify-downstream.yml`.

## Architecture

ToolRegistry is organized around a central `ToolRegistry` class composed of
7 orthogonal mixins:

| Mixin | File | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| RegistrationMixin | `_mixins/registration.py` | Register/unregister tools from functions, classes, MCP, OpenAPI |
| EnableDisableMixin | `_mixins/enable_disable.py` | Enable/disable tools, track reasons, metadata updates |
| NamespaceMixin | `_mixins/namespace.py` | Namespace prefixing, merge, spinoff sub-registries |
| PermissionsMixin | `_mixins/permissions.py` | Tag-based permission policies, sync/async handlers |
| ExecutionLoggingMixin | `_mixins/logging.py` | In-memory call history (name, args, result, duration) |
| AdminMixin | `_mixins/admin.py` | Web admin panel lifecycle |
| ChangeCallbackMixin | `_mixins/callbacks.py` | Event subscriptions (register, enable, error, etc.) |

Key standalone modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `tool.py` | `Tool`, `ToolMetadata`, `ToolTag`, `TOOLCALL_REASON_PROPERTY` |
| `tool_discovery.py` | BM25-based fuzzy tool search (`ToolDiscoveryTool`) |
| `parameter_models.py` | JSON Schema generation from Python signatures |
| `_rosetta.py` | Multi-provider schema bridge (via `llm-rosetta`) |
| `truncation.py` | Result truncation with temp file persistence |
| `admin/` | HTTP server, REST handlers, execution log, auth, static assets |
| `executor/` | Thread/process pool execution backends |
| `permissions/` | Policy engine, handler protocol, built-in rules |
| `config/` | Declarative JSONC/YAML config loader |
| `integrations/` | Native, MCP, OpenAPI, LangChain integration packages |

```

## Setup and commands

```bash
conda activate toolregistry
pip install -e ".[dev,test,mcp]"
pre-commit install
```

Run `make help` for all targets. Key ones:

```bash
make lint          # ruff check + ty check + complexipy
make fmt           # ruff check --fix + ruff format
make test          # pytest tests/ -v
make build         # python -m build
make push          # twine upload
```

Tooling config (ruff, ty, complexipy) lives in `pyproject.toml`.

## Definition of done

1. `pre-commit run --all-files` passes (ruff, ruff-format, ty, complexipy)
2. `pytest tests/ -v` passes — run from the repo root, not `pytest` bare
3. New code has tests in `tests/`
4. Google-style docstrings on public APIs; comments in English
5. No manual edits to `_vendor/` — update upstream in zerodep, re-vendor via CLI
6. `ruff format` covers both `src/` **and** `tests/`

## Workflow

- **Branch from master**, open a PR, require CI green before merge.
- **Merge strategy: rebase** — keep commits atomic and well-messaged.
- Branch naming: `feature/...`, `fix/...`, `refactor/...`, `test/...`, `docs/...`
- Never force-push to `master` unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Documentation

User-facing docs live on **orphan branches** (`docs_en`, `docs_zh`), mounted
as git worktrees at `./docs_en/` and `./docs_zh/`. Built with zensical.

```bash
# Edit docs in-place (worktrees already mounted)
cd docs_en/docs/
# Commit and push inside the worktree
```

### When to update docs worktrees

Update `docs_en/` and `docs_zh/` whenever any of the following happens:

- **New public API added or signature changed**: update the relevant API
  reference pages in both languages.
- **Behavior change or bug fix affecting documented functionality**: update
  affected guide/reference pages.
- **Changelog-worthy change merged to main branch**: update
  `docs_en/docs/changelog.md` and `docs_zh/docs/changelog.md` under the
  `[Unreleased]` section. Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
  format. Entries should cover: features, enhancements, bug fixes,
  breaking changes, and infrastructure.
- **Release published**: move `[Unreleased]` entries into a new versioned
  section in both changelogs, then create a GitHub Release:
  ```bash
  gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "..."
  ```
  Release notes should mirror the versioned changelog section (in English).
  Include an installation snippet and a "Full Changelog" compare link.

### Cross-language consistency (enforced)

**Both language versions must be updated in the same task/agent run.** Never
update only one language and leave the other for later. The workflow is:

1. Make changes to `docs_en/` first (English is the source of truth).
2. In the same task, apply equivalent changes to `docs_zh/` before committing.
3. Commit and push both worktrees before the task is considered done.

Splitting the two languages across separate agents or separate sessions is not
allowed — it leads to drift and missed pages.

Commits in doc worktrees use `PRE_COMMIT_ALLOW_NO_CONFIG=1 git commit` since
those branches have no `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Escalation

- Schema generation mismatch → check `_rosetta.py` and `llm-rosetta` version
- Rosetta compat failure → see `rosetta-compat.yml` CI, check upstream release
- `_vendor/` issues → never fix in-place; update in zerodep repo, re-vendor
- Pre-existing CI failure (complexipy on `_update_config`) → known, not blocking
- Test failure after 3 attempts → stop, report full output
- Never: delete files to fix errors, skip tests, modify `_vendor/` directly

## Files to never edit

- `src/toolregistry/_vendor/**` — vendored from zerodep, managed via `zerodep` CLI
- `docs_en/`, `docs_zh/` — separate git branches, edit inside the worktree only
