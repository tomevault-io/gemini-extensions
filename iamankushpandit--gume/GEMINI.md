# Agent instructions

This project keeps its guidance in **`CLAUDE.md`** files. They apply to everyone who changes this repository — every agent regardless of which tool you are, and every human contributor too. There is one rulebook, not an agent track and a people track: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers how work reaches the protected `main` and `dev` branches, and these files cover what the code itself has to honour. Read them as your instructions.

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — start here: build commands, architecture, invariants, and the protocol for working alongside other agents
- [`src/engine/CLAUDE.md`](src/engine/CLAUDE.md) — screen lifecycle, catalogs, progress tracking
- [`src/games/CLAUDE.md`](src/games/CLAUDE.md) — how to add or change a game
- [`src/hal/CLAUDE.md`](src/hal/CLAUDE.md) — hardware, persistence, profiles, watchdog
- [`src/ui/CLAUDE.md`](src/ui/CLAUDE.md) — theming and drawing helpers

**Modularity rule:** If a file is becoming large (as a rule of thumb, `src/main.cpp` > ~400 lines of active logic in one function, or any `.cpp` > ~600 lines total), **refactor it into a more modular form first** before making the requested change. The refactor must not break existing functionality and must land as its own commit before the feature change that prompted it.

**System/UI app orientation rule:** Any screen that is a system utility (Settings, Wi-Fi, SystemInfo, Profiles, Scores, About, or any future app beyond the playable game catalog) must work in **both landscape and portrait**. Read `tft.width()` / `tft.height()` at render time, not `SCREEN_WIDTH`/`SCREEN_HEIGHT`. Use `Ui::drawTab()` for multi-section layouts; the strip adapts when you divide screen width at render time.

## Two standing rules — you should never have to be told these

**1. No AI attribution in commits, ever -- and no AI in the names either.** Do
not add `Co-Authored-By: Claude`, `Co-Authored-By: <any AI>`, "Generated
with..." footers, or any other trailer or sign-off naming an AI tool or model.
The repository's history records the author, and that is a human. Check your
commit message before you run `git commit` -- this applies to amends, squashes
and PR bodies too.

The same goes for the word itself. No `claude`, and no other model or vendor
name, anywhere your contribution leaves a trace: branch names, commit subjects
and bodies, PR titles and descriptions, file names, identifiers, comments and
TODOs. A branch called `claude/fix-the-thing` says who typed rather than what
changed, and it is permanent in a way the session is not -- it lands in the
merge commit, the pull request and every clone. Name a branch for its work:
`feat/<game-id>`, `fix/<area>`, `docs/<topic>`. Already on one that breaks this?
Rename it before opening the PR (`git branch -m <new-name>`).

The `CLAUDE.md` files are the one exception, because that filename is how you
found these instructions. The rule is about what a *change* carries.

**2. Keep the docs in sync as part of the change, not as a follow-up.** If your
change alters behaviour, structure, dependencies, screens, settings, the game
list or the build, then in the *same* commit you also update whichever of these
it touched:

| You changed | Update |
|---|---|
| Anything user-visible or the feature set | `README.md` — including the games count, the flash/RAM figures from your own `pio run`, and the version |
| Architecture, invariants, layout, build flags, dependencies | `CLAUDE.md` |
| The agent protocol itself | `AGENTS.md` (this file) |
| A subsystem's rules | the `CLAUDE.md` in that directory |
| A new game | `src/games/CLAUDE.md` and the README game table |

Do not wait to be asked, and do not leave it for "a docs pass later". A stale
`README.md` that claims the wrong game count or the wrong flash figure is a
defect, and it is your defect if you shipped the change that made it wrong.

**Run `python tools/check_docs.py` before you commit.** It fails if the version,
the game count, the source-tree listing or the build figures have drifted, and
if the About app has started restating facts instead of deriving them. These
rules existed and the docs went stale anyway -- the README shipped claiming 23
games when there were 26, and the source listing missed three files that had
been added. Asking for vigilance does not work at the end of a long change; the
check does. It is not a substitute for reading the prose, only for the parts a
machine can catch.

If your change alters a screen's layout, or adds or removes one, regenerate the
mock-ups in the same commit: `python tools/gen_screens.py`. `docs/screens/` kept
images of the deleted Countries game for two releases, and the Settings picture
showed a grid that no longer existed. A mock-up of a screen that is not there
any more is a worse lie than a missing one.

## The About app is user-facing documentation — keep it true

`AboutApp` is the only documentation most owners will ever read, and the only
one they read *while holding the device*. It is part of the deliverable, not a
credits screen. **Update it in the same commit as the change it describes.**

It was already six games out of date once, because it kept a hand-written list.
The fix, and the standing rule, is to **derive rather than restate**:

| About shows | Derived from |
|---|---|
| Version | `BRAINO_VERSION` |
| Game count and every game name/blurb | `GAME_CATALOG` |
| Board name | `BOARD_NAME` |
| Wi-Fi status | `Board::hasWifiCredentials()` / `isWifiConnected()` |
| Beacon status and advertised name | `BleBeacon::active()` / `configured()` |
| Whether scores are being shared | `BleBeacon::configured().sharesActivity` |

If you are about to type a fact into About that the firmware already knows, read
it from the firmware instead. Anything genuinely static — the credits, the
privacy statements — must be re-read whenever the thing it describes changes.

## No identifiers in this repository — the rule that cannot be broken

**Never commit anything that identifies one physical device, one network or one
person.** Not in a tool file, not in a comment, not in a fixture, not
temporarily, and not because the design reads better that way. Such values live
on the machine that owns the hardware, gitignored.

An agent wrote `tools/board_registry.json`, mapping six boards' **MAC
addresses** to the firmware each ran. It was tracked for three commits and
shipped in two release tarballs. It was a deliberate, reasonable-looking design
decision, which is the point: reasonable is not the test.

A MAC is burned into eFuse — it cannot be changed, so publishing one names that
board for the life of the silicon, and deleting the file does not un-publish it
because history, clones, forks and tarballs all keep copies.

- Identify a board by **`Board::deviceId()`** (`R28T-9F3A2C71`): firmware
  generated, one-way hashed so the MAC cannot be recovered, prefixed with the
  *model* tag, and reissued by a factory reset.
- The boot banner prints `device=`, never `mac=`. That line gets pasted into
  public issues.
- `tools/board_registry.json` is gitignored; the `.example.json` ships with
  placeholders and `ESP32_boardUtil.py --learn` fills in the real one locally.
- **Ask a board before you reset it.** Current firmware answers `identify` on
  the serial port with one `ok ...` line (device id, board, version, build)
  and keeps running; `ESP32_boardUtil.py` does this first and resets only a
  board that stays silent. `--no-reset` never resets. A reset discards another
  agent's in-flight test, and on the bench an E32R40T once needed its battery
  pulled to boot again after one.
- **Configure boards with `python tools/configure_boards.py`, not by hand.** It
  applies `tools/bench_config.json` (gitignored -- it holds a Wi-Fi password
  and names; start from `bench_config.example.json`) to every board that
  answers `identify`, through the serial console behind the admin PIN. Never
  commit that file, and never paste the tool's input into an issue.
- **A new console command is a row in the table** in
  `src/engine/AppRuntimeConsole.cpp`, and a new device setting is a row in
  `AppRuntimeConsoleSettings.cpp` -- never another string match. Each answers
  with one `ok key="v"` or `err <code> <message>` line, keys in word
  characters only. Anything that writes, or reads player data, gets a gated
  capability, which puts it behind the PIN automatically.
- `python tools/check_identifiers.py` runs in CI. It catches MACs and public
  IPs; it cannot catch an SSID or a person's name, so a clean run is not
  permission.
- **Every file you add carries its own licence notice.** SPDX identifier,
  holder (`iamankushpandit`), where it came from, what reuse requires -- source,
  scripts, workflows, and documents as a visible footer. Do not type one: run
  `python tools/check_licenses.py --fix`, which is also what CI checks. A
  generated file gets its notice from its generator, via `header_for()` in that
  same tool, so regenerating cannot strip it.

## No data collection — the rule that outranks the feature

Braino collects nothing about the player using it, and no change may alter
that. It is not a setting that ships switched off; it is what the product is.
Exactly three things leave the device: an NTP time query, one `ip-api.com`
lookup to guess the timezone on first connect, and the opt-in, non-connectable
BLE beacon. **That list is closed.** Do not add analytics, usage counters,
crash reporting, any other HTTP/UDP/DNS request, any dependency that phones
home at runtime, or anything transmitted that carries a player's name, profile
name, score, progress or typing. A fourth outbound flow needs the maintainer's
agreement in an issue *before* the code exists — it is a change to what the
product promises, not a feature to be reviewed on merit.

Storing is not collecting: scores and profiles live in this device's own NVS
and never leave it. The full statement, including what to update if a
transmitted-data change is ever agreed, is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#no-data-collection).

**A privacy claim that has drifted from the hardware is worse than none at all,
because it is believed.** If you add or change anything that transmits, stores
or shares data, the About radio page and the README Privacy section are part of
that change. Not a follow-up.

About is also a system app, so it follows the orientation rule: lay out against
`tft.width()` / `tft.height()`, never `SCREEN_WIDTH` / `SCREEN_HEIGHT`.

## Responsiveness rule — know what a frame costs

The loop runs at a 20ms budget (`FRAME_BUDGET_MS`) and paces to a deadline: it
sleeps only the remainder, so a slow frame is not punished twice. That budget is
the whole allowance for touch, logic and drawing. Three things have each eaten
most of it at some point in this codebase, and all three look harmless at the
call site:

1. **NVS reads.** `Preferences` is flash-backed — every getter is a hash lookup,
   not a variable read. `screenSaverSeconds()` ran once per loop iteration and
   `gameVisible()` up to ~180 times per launcher repaint. **Anything read more
   than once per screen change gets a write-through RAM mirror in `Board`**:
   the setter updates the mirror and NVS together, so a stale read is not
   possible. Theme, layout, brightness, idle timeout, active profile, game
   visibility and the Wi-Fi credentials all work this way now. Add to that list
   rather than reaching for `prefs_` in a hot path.
2. **Blocking `delay()` inside a getter.** Battery sensing slept 10ms per call
   and `Ui::drawTopBar()` calls two battery getters, so every top bar cost
   ~20ms — a whole frame — before anything was drawn. **No `delay()` in
   anything a render path can reach.** Sample on a cadence and cache.
3. **Rebuilding content that did not change.** System Info reassembled every
   row on every frame while scrolling. Scrolling changes an offset, not
   content. Gate rebuilds behind a stale flag.

Before claiming a screen is fast: System Info's Memory tab shows loop load,
worst work and worst frame, and the watchdog logs a stall past
`STALL_WARN_MS`. A worst frame above ~40ms is a bug, not a heavy screen.

Related: full-screen repaints are ~150KB over SPI and ~30ms of visible blanking,
which is why `Game` has two levels of invalidation. Guard static chrome behind
`needsFullRender()` and repaint only what moved.

## Redraw rule -- a full repaint is the exception

**A FULL REDRAW IS THE EXCEPTION, IN EVERY GAME. Earn it.**

`markFullDirty()` clears the screen and repaints the chrome: ~150KB over SPI
and roughly 30ms of visible blanking, which is one and a half frame budgets.
Doing it to change a few pixels is not a lost optimisation, it is a **visible
flash** in the player's hand, and on a screen that updates often it is the
first thing anybody notices.

Before reaching for it, ask what actually changed on the panel:

- **Something appeared?** Draw it. Nothing needs erasing, so nothing needs
  clearing: overdraw it and touch nothing else.
- **Something moved?** Erase its own box and repaint the guide over that box.
  Derive the box from the geometry that drew the thing; never type in a
  rectangle. Drawing functions that paint exactly what is already there in the
  same colours are **idempotent**, so re-running one whole is visually a no-op
  outside the box you cleared, which is usually cheaper and always simpler than
  working out precisely which pieces overlapped.
- **Something animating on its own clock?** Make it change colour rather than
  size. A marker that never grows never has to be erased, which is what keeps
  the incremental path available at all.
- **The scene genuinely changed** (a new question, a new letter, a new screen,
  an end-of-game banner)? *Then* repaint fully. A stable picture is worth the
  frame it costs when the whole picture is new.

This is not theoretical. `LetterTracer`'s direction arrow was first written to
`markFullDirty()` whenever it moved, on the reasoning that a moving arrow
changes the picture's shape and turns are rare. Turns are not rare: a
three-letter joined word has about eleven, so tracing one word cleared the
screen eleven times, and it was reported from the device as the screen
flashing. The fix was fifteen lines (erase the arrow's own box, repaint the
ghost and the dots over it) and the reasoning that produced the bug was a guess
about frequency that was never checked.

The same rule holds for the top bar: route clock, battery and notification
changes through `requestChromeRender()`, not `requestRender()`.

Related: `Game` has two levels of invalidation for exactly this reason.
`markDirty()` repaints the moving parts; `markFullDirty()` repaints the
background and chrome as well. Guard static chrome behind
`needsFullRender()`.

## Memory rule — there is no garbage collector

C++ gives you no GC, and FreeRTOS gives you a heap that can never be compacted.
So the thing that kills this device is not the leak you are picturing. There is
not one `new`, `delete`, `malloc` or `free` in this firmware — every screen is a
`static` instance and everything else is stack or a fixed member. **Keep it that
way**, and the classic leak is impossible by construction.

What actually kills it is **fragmentation**: many small allocations of differing
sizes, made and freed over and over, chop the free space into pieces too small
to satisfy a later request. Free heap looks fine right up to the allocation that
fails, hours in. The only visible symptom beforehand is the fragmentation
percentage, which is why System Info shows it.

The offender is almost always Arduino `String`. Every concatenation allocates,
every assignment may reallocate, and a `String` member that is rewritten each
frame is a long-lived block being freed and re-made 27 times a second.

Rules, in the order they bite:

1. **No raw owning allocation.** No `new`/`delete`, no `malloc`/`free`, no
   owning raw pointers. If something genuinely must be dynamic, justify it in a
   comment and give it an owner with a destructor.
2. **No `String` in anything that runs per frame.** Build text with `snprintf`
   into a stack buffer, or store it in a fixed `char[]`. `RowList` (`src/ui/`)
   is the worked example: it was 48 rows × 2 `String`s rebuilt every frame —
   about 96 long-lived allocations churning at frame rate — and is now flat
   char buffers that allocate nothing, ever.
3. **Don't rebuild content on every frame.** Rebuild when the data changed and
   keep a `stale` flag. Scrolling changes an offset, not the content.
4. **A `String` member on a screen is a smell.** A few exist for genuinely
   user-entered text (`ProfileApp::draft_`, `WifiApp::password_`) — that is
   the bar. Anything derived from state belongs in a fixed buffer.
5. **Give back what you borrowed, in `end()`.** Every screen transition goes
   through `BrainoApp::leaveActiveGame()`, which compares free heap
   against the value captured before that screen's `begin()` and logs
   `[heap] '<screen>' left N bytes short` when a screen does not hand it back.
   Watch the serial log after adding a screen.
6. **Prefer fixed-size members over growth.** A statically sized array that is
   occasionally half empty is cheaper and safer here than anything that grows.
   Trading a few hundred bytes of static RAM for zero heap traffic is nearly
   always the right call on this device — `RowList` cost 864 bytes of RAM and
   *saved* 5.5 KB of flash.
7. **Check the numbers before you claim it is fine.** `pio run` reports RAM and
   flash; System Info's Memory tab reports free heap, minimum free heap,
   largest allocatable block and fragmentation. Read them.

## Adding a game or an app — the whole checklist

The old version of this list had five items, all of them code. Everything that
has since been shipped broken or stale was *outside* those five: the README game
table, the screenshot gallery, `docs/screens/`, the changelog. A game that
launches correctly and is invisible in every document describing the product is
not finished.

Work through all four groups. Nothing here is optional for a screen that ships.

### 1. Code — miss one and it fails silently or won't link

1. `src/games/NewGame.{h,cpp}` — subclass `Game`.
2. `src/engine/GameCatalog.cpp` — append an entry. Blurbs render at font 1
   across ~292 px, so keep them under ~46 chars. **`id` is a persisted NVS
   visibility key**: renaming it later resets that game's visibility on every
   existing device.
3. `src/main.cpp` — add to `enum class EntryKind`.
4. `src/main.cpp` — add to `CATALOG_KINDS[]` **at the same index as the catalog
   entry**. Nothing enforces this; a misalignment compiles, links, and launches
   the wrong game from the right tile.
5. `src/main.cpp` — a `case` in `launchKind()` (wires the instance) and one in
   `drawLauncherIcon()` (draws the tile icon).
6. `src/engine/ScoreCatalog.cpp` — only if it records a score, so the Scores
   screen can show it.

### 2. Docs — the part that actually gets forgotten

7. `README.md` — a row in the right game table (what it is and what it
   builds), or a bullet under the system screens if it is an app.
8. `README.md` — an `<img>` in the matching screenshot gallery.
9. `CHANGELOG.md` — an entry under the unreleased heading.

### 3. Screens

10. `tools/gen_screens.py` — a render function plus an entry in `SCREENS` or
    `EXTRA_SCREENS`. Take the geometry from the game's own `Rect` helpers so
    the mock-up matches the device rather than approximating it.
11. Run `python tools/gen_screens.py` and **look at the PNG**. It is a
    generated image; nothing else will tell you it came out wrong.

### 4. Verify

12. `pio run` — and put the new flash/RAM figures in `README.md` **and**
    `CLAUDE.md`. They are the two places that disagree.
13. `python tools/check_docs.py` — must be clean.
14. Flash it and actually play it. Take the board lock first.

### What you do NOT hand-edit

These derive from `GAME_CATALOG` and update themselves. Editing them by hand is
how About fell six games behind in the first place:

- the **About** app's game list, count and blurbs
- the **About** app's *This build* page, System Info's `Branch`/`Commit`/
  `Built` rows and the `[boot] build=` serial line -- all three read
  `BuildStamp::`, which `tools/build_stamp.py` fills in from git at build
  time. Never type a branch or a commit into a screen
- the **Settings → Games** visibility list
- the **launcher** tiles and paging
- the **GitHub Pages site** — `tools/gen_site.py` reads the version from
  `AppVersion.h`, the game list and blurbs from `GAME_CATALOG`, the build
  figures from `README.md` and the board name from `platformio.ini`. Edit
  `site/index.template.html` for wording and layout only; `check_docs.py`
  fails if a version number is typed into it

### If it is a system app rather than a game

Everything above still applies, plus:

- It **must work in both orientations.** Read `tft.width()` / `tft.height()` at
  render time, never `SCREEN_WIDTH` / `SCREEN_HEIGHT`. Settings and Wi-Fi
  currently violate this and are the reason the rule is stated so bluntly.
- If it touches a radio, stores data, or changes what leaves the device, the
  **About radios page** and the **README privacy section** are part of the same
  change — and About must *read* the state, not restate it.

## Supporting a new board — the whole checklist

**The mechanics are in [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md) and are now small**: a
board is a profile header in `include/boards/` plus a `[board_*]` section in
`platformio.ini`, and nothing under `src/` names a GPIO. Read that first — this
section is about everything a port needs *around* the code, which is the part
that has actually been getting skipped.

Before adding support for a new hardware variant, complete a comprehensive hardware reference and verification app. This prevents silent failures, driver misconfigurations, and port-specific quirks from reaching users.

### 1. Hardware documentation — must precede any game support

1. **Check the board can be supported at all.** A panel of at least 320×240 in
   landscape, a touch controller, the backlight on a GPIO, and 4 MB of flash
   are hard requirements; a board missing one fails to compile and is out of
   scope, not a porting task. SD, LED, speaker and battery sense are optional
   and the firmware does without them. The table is in
   [docs/PORTING.md](docs/PORTING.md).

2. **Create `BOARD_<VARIANT>.md`** — complete hardware reference for the new board
   - Copy structure from [`BOARD_E32R28T-1.md`](BOARD_E32R28T-1.md) — the template
   - Sections: overview, GPIO pinout, display driver, touch, battery sensing, RGB LED, radios, memory, watchdog, known issues, verification procedures
   - Include all TFT_eSPI flags, SPI frequencies, ADC attenuation, power thresholds
   - Document every GPIO assignment and SPI bus topology (which devices share which buses?)
   - **List every known hardware bug, quirk and workaround** (crossed LED pins, inverted polarity, ADC2 unavailable, etc.)
   - Do NOT skip "known issues" section — it is where you prevent the next person from re-discovering the same bugs

3. **Update `AGENTS.md`** to reference the new board file in this section

4. **Write `include/boards/<id>.h`** — the board profile. Pins, rotations, the
   battery divider, and `PIN_NONE` for anything the board does not wire. Label
   every value with its field name in a `/* comment */`; `check_boards.py`
   reads those labels to prove nothing was left out.

5. **Add `[board_<id>]` and `[env:<name>]` to `platformio.ini`** — the board
   section carries only `BOARD_NAME`, `GUME_BOARD_HEADER`, the driver and the
   TFT_eSPI pin/size/SPI macros. Everything shared is already in `[common]`,
   and putting a board-specific flag there fails `check_boards.py`. The
   environment composes `${common.build_flags}` with exactly one
   `${board_*.build_flags}`.

6. **Put it on the web installer.** `tools/gen_site.py` derives its board list
   from those same sections, so add a `BOARD_DETAILS` entry (label, chip
   family, where to buy one) and make sure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
   `pages.yml` build the environment. A board that can be supported must be
   flashable by the person who owns it, not only by someone with a toolchain;
   `check_boards.py` fails the port until that is true.

### 2. Hardware verification app — exercises all subsystems before game support

1. **Create a bringup/test app** (can extend the existing `env:bringup` environment)
   - Exercises every hardware subsystem: display, touch, battery, BLE, Wi-Fi, RGB LED
   - Each subsystem has a simple test: fill colors, show coordinates, read voltage, scan networks
   - Display full-screen color test + rotation check + brightness slider
   - Touch: show crosshairs, tap them, verify coordinates match screen, check pressure threshold
   - Battery: show voltage and percentage against a meter (there is no charging state -- the CYD boards have no charge-status line)
   - BLE: turn beacon on/off, use phone scanner to verify name and payload format
   - Wi-Fi: connect to network, fetch NTP time, verify clock advances
   - RGB LED: show all colours, verify no crossed polarity or missing channels
   - Run tests from serial monitor or on-device UI menu

2. **All tests must pass before merging the variant into main:**
   - [ ] Display renders all colors correctly at native resolution
   - [ ] Touch calibration works; coordinates accurate to ±10 pixels
   - [ ] Battery readings within 0.1V of meter; percentage tracks a real discharge
   - [ ] BLE beacon visible on phone with correct device name and manufacturer data payload
   - [ ] Wi-Fi connects and fetches time; clock is correct
   - [ ] RGB LED shows correct colours (no crossed channels)
   - [ ] Watchdog reboot works (hang the loop; device reboots after 12s)

3. **Document test procedures in the board file** — section 11: Hardware Verification Procedures
   - Step-by-step instructions so future agents can verify a new board independently
   - Expected success criteria (e.g., "voltage within ±0.1V of meter")

### 3. Architecture changes for multi-board support (applies if adding non-playable-game code)

1. **`ScaledRenderer` or similar display scaling** — if supporting different resolutions (e.g., 240×320 vs 480×320)
   - Games author to fixed 320×240 logical canvas
   - Renderer stretches to physical panel size
   - Touch reverse-scales from physical space back to logical canvas

2. **Pin abstraction layer** — already built; use it rather than adding to it
   - Do NOT hardcode pins in driver code. Read `BOARD` (`include/BoardProfile.h`)
   - If the fact you need is not on `BOARD`, add the field and fill it in for
     every existing board in the same commit — do not add a `#if` instead
   - It is all `constexpr`, so it costs nothing at runtime

3. **Driver selection flags** — if multiple display/touch controllers
   - Use `-D PANEL_<NAME>=1` and `#if PANEL_<NAME>` in driver init
   - TFT_eSPI already supports this via `-D <DRIVER>=1` flags

### 4. Verification before merge

1. `python tools/check_docs.py` and `python tools/check_boards.py` — both must pass
2. `pio run -e app` and `pio run -e <new variant>` — both must build
3. The board is offered by the web installer, and CI builds its firmware — a
   board people cannot flash from the page is not a supported board
4. Firmware flashes successfully on the new board
5. All hardware verification tests pass
6. At least one playable game runs and is responsive (no frames > 40ms)

### What NOT to do

- Do NOT claim support for a board that trips one of the hard requirements. It
  is out of scope, and the static_assert saying so is the answer, not an
  obstacle to work around
- Do NOT land a board the web installer does not offer — support that needs a
  toolchain is not support for the person who owns the board
- Do NOT add support for a new board without a `BOARD_<VARIANT>.md` file
- Do NOT merge to `main` unless all verification tests pass
- Do NOT ship a board driver without documenting known bugs and workarounds
- Do NOT change display/touch driver code without also updating the board reference file

## The web installer is part of the deliverable

`https://iamankushpandit.github.io/Gume/` flashes a board from the browser over
Web Serial. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds all four PlatformIO
environments on every push to `main`, runs `tools/gen_site.py`, and drops the
resulting `.bin` files beside the manifest that points at them. Nobody
regenerates it by hand, so it cannot go stale on its own — but three things
break it, and all three fail in someone else's browser rather than here:

1. **Adding or renaming a PlatformIO environment.** The page offers one
   firmware per entry in `gen_site.py`'s `VARIANTS`; if the workflow does not
   build that env, its manifest points at binaries that do not exist and the
   flash fails partway. `check_docs.py` cross-checks `VARIANTS` against
   `platformio.ini` and the workflow.
2. **Changing what the firmware transmits or stores.** The page carries a
   privacy section, and the same rule applies to it as to the About radio page
   and the README: a privacy claim that has drifted from the hardware is worse
   than none, because it is believed.
3. **Making CI unable to build.** `main` deliberately points `map-n-flag` at a
   machine-local path; the workflow rewrites that line in its own working copy.
   If `lib_deps` changes shape, fix the `sed` in the same commit.

`python tools/gen_site.py` writes `site/_build/` locally so you can look at the
page. The flash button will 404 there — the binaries only exist in CI.

Four things that cause real damage here if you skip them:

1. **Branch into your own worktree before you start, from `dev`.** New requirement → `git worktree add ../GUme-<slug> -b feat/<slug> dev`, then work there. **Every feature and every fix starts from `dev`** — the only exceptions are a base the maintainer explicitly asked for, or an agreed hotfix onto a release branch, and both are said out loud in the request before the work starts. **`dev` looking stale does not make it the wrong base, and this is not yours to overrule.** That has already gone wrong once: an agent saw `dev` 55 commits behind `main`, branched from `main` instead and justified it in prose — from local refs it had never fetched. `git fetch origin` showed `dev` was five commits *ahead*. So fetch before forming any opinion (`git rev-list --left-right --count origin/dev...origin/main`), and if it still looks wrong, **say what you measured and ask** — explaining a decision is not the same as being given one. Basing on `main` "and rebasing later" is not a shortcut either: `main`'s release commits ride along, carrying the version bump that drops `-SNAPSHOT` into a branch meant to keep it. Do **not** `git switch` inside the main checkout: it holds other agents' uncommitted work and switching under them strands it. A worktree also gives you a private `.pio/` build dir.
2. **Multiple agents share this repo.** Read `git status` first; uncommitted work that isn't yours is normal. Stage explicit paths, never `git add -A`. Don't merge or push unless asked. **`main` and `dev` are protected on GitHub** — no force-push, no deletion, and every merge goes through a pull request with the `verify` CI job green. Land work on `dev`; `main` takes releases from `dev` once they have been tested on hardware. **A release is cut by pushing a `v*` tag on `main`** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds every environment, packs them with `tools/pack_release.py` and publishes the binaries, and it refuses to publish if the tag disagrees with `BRAINO_VERSION` or the version is a `-SNAPSHOT`. Do not assemble a release by hand. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#branches-and-protection).
3. **`GAME_CATALOG[]` and `CATALOG_KINDS[]` are index-coupled across two files** and a bad merge misaligns them silently — it still compiles and links, and the only symptom is a tile launching the wrong game. Re-verify entry-for-entry after every merge.
4. **One physical board, one serial port** — shared across all branches and worktrees. Don't flash or factory-reset without saying so; it wipes calibration, profiles and scores another agent may be testing against.
5. **Take the board lock before building or flashing.** It lives at `(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/gume-board.lock` so it's visible from every worktree. If it's held by a live process, wait and poll. If no build or flash process is actually running, the lock is stale — delete it and carry on, and say that you did. Release your own lock even when the build fails.
