# Repository-level Agent Guide

Reply in the same language as the user.

This is a TypeScript monorepo built for agent-assisted development. Keep the root `AGENTS.md` limited to hot-path rules: the project map, hard constraints, and workflow requirements — things every task needs to know.

## Project Overview

**NightHawk** is a security-first AI agent for the terminal — penetration testing, code audit, and full-strength coding in one loop. It pairs a modern coding agent core (Plan/Act/Observe/Reflect loop, sub-agents, MCP, skills, persistent memory) with a native security engine — 116+ vulnerability rules mapped to OWASP Top 10 and CWE, Shannon-entropy secret detection, cross-file taint analysis, and dependency auditing (offline, OSV, and host package-manager) — all exposed as first-class tools the agent can invoke mid-session.

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, ES2024 target, bundler module resolution)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 10.33.0 (monorepo workspaces)
- **Runtime**: Node.js ≥ 24.15.0
- **Build Tools**: tsdown (for bundling), TypeScript 6.0.2
- **Testing**: Vitest 4.1.4 (unit/integration tests), custom smoke tests, node:test for pi-tui
- **Linting**: oxlint 1.59.0 with TypeScript-aware rules
- **Formatting**: oxlint auto-fix + lint-staged with git hooks
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (sharded test runs, linting, typechecking, security smoke tests)
- **Release Management**: Changesets for versioning and changelogs
- **Documentation**: VitePress for bilingual docs (English/Chinese)
- **Nix**: Flake-based build and dev shells for reproducible environments

### Key Architecture Components

1. **Agent Core Engine** (`packages/agent-core-v2`): The main agent engine with DI × Scope architecture (App/Workspace/Session/Agent scopes)
2. **KAP Server** (`packages/kap-server`): NightHawk server exposing REST + WebSocket APIs
3. **LLM Abstraction** (`packages/kosong`): Provider-agnostic LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek)
4. **Execution Environment** (`packages/kaos`): File/process abstractions for local/remote execution
5. **Security Engine**: 116+ vulnerability rules, secret scanning, taint analysis (production code in `packages/agent-core/src/tools/builtin/security/`)
6. **Terminal UI** (`packages/pi-tui`): Component framework for the TUI
7. **Client SDK** (`packages/klient`): Contract-driven facade over agent-core-v2

## Working Principles

- Think from first principles. Start from real requirements, code facts, and verification results; if the goal is unclear, discuss it with the user first.
- Treat code, not documentation, as the source of truth. Unless the user explicitly says otherwise, do not read ordinary Markdown just to understand the implementation.
- Before making code changes, read the relevant code and the most recent constraints, and follow the nearest `AGENTS.md` in the directory tree.
- Keep changes focused. Do not slip in unrelated refactors along the way.
- When committing, do not add any co-author attribution, and do not reveal the identity of the agent in commit messages, PR descriptions, or any explanatory text.

## Project Map

### Applications
- `apps/nighthawk`: The CLI / TUI application. It consumes core capabilities through `@nighthawk/nighthawk-sdk` and must not depend directly on `@nighthawk/agent-core`. When writing or modifying its terminal UI, use the `write-tui` skill (`.agents/skills/write-tui/SKILL.md`).
- `apps/vscode`: VS Code extension for NightHawk.
- `apps/nighthawk-inspect`: Web inspector for the kap-server `/api/v1/debug` RPC surface — workspace/session browser, per-session transcript chat, per-scope Service panels, and the DI unit inspection view. See `apps/nighthawk-inspect/AGENTS.md`.
- `apps/vis`, `apps/vis/server`, `apps/vis/web`: Visual debugging tools for sessions and replays.
- the browser web UI: **Its source no longer lives in this repo.** It is developed in the code-app repo (`apps/web`) and shipped as the committed, prebuilt bundle `apps/nighthawk/dist-web` (gitignored, force-added), synced from code-app with `NIGHTHAWK_REPO=<this checkout> pnpm run sync:web` — sync and commit the bundle in the same change whenever the web UI should ship differently. `apps/nighthawk/scripts/check-web-assets.mjs` guards packaging against a missing bundle. To hack on the web UI against this repo's server, run `pnpm dev:server` here and point code-app's `pnpm dev:web` at it via `NIGHTHAWK_SERVER_URL`.

### Core Packages
- `packages/agent-core`: The unified agent engine (v1), including Agent, Session, profile, skills, tools, plan, permission, background, records, the in-process DI service layer (`src/services/`), and other core capabilities. See `packages/agent-core/AGENTS.md`.
- `packages/agent-core-v2`: The DI × Scope agent engine (v2, the current version behind kap-server). Four `LifecycleScope` tiers — `App` / `Workspace` / `Session` / `Agent` (`app/scopes.ts`) — plus the L3 unit layer (`Service`/`Fiber` units, collection contribution points, the Feature seam in `src/features/`); there is no App-level session lifecycle facade — callers compose `ISessionIndex` → `IWorkspaceLifecycleService.handlerFor` → the handler. See `packages/agent-core-v2/AGENTS.md` and use the `agent-core-dev` skill (`.agents/skills/agent-core-dev/SKILL.md`) when developing here.
- `packages/kap-server`: The NightHawk server, backed by `@nighthawk/agent-core-v2`; exposes sessions over REST + WebSocket (`/api/v1` + `/api/v1/ws`), plus the `/api/v1/debug/*` reflection RPC surface (`--debug-endpoints`, loopback bind + bearer auth). See `packages/kap-server/AGENTS.md`.
- `packages/klient`: The client SDK — a contract-driven facade over agent-core-v2 (`global.*` / `session(id).*` / `agent(id).*`, zod-validated); transport via subpath entry (`@nighthawk/klient/ipc|memory`, both return the same `Klient`); also hosts the e2e suites. See `packages/klient/AGENTS.md`.
- `packages/node-sdk`: The public TypeScript SDK and harness (`@nighthawk/nighthawk-sdk`).
- `packages/kosong`: The LLM / provider abstraction layer — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and compatible protocols.
- `packages/kaos`: The execution environment and file/process abstractions over local or remote hosts.
- `packages/oauth`: OAuth and managed auth utilities for multiple providers.
- `packages/telemetry`: Shared client-side telemetry infrastructure.
- `packages/transcript`: The isomorphic transcript rendering data layer — L1 agent-granular store, L2 idempotent operations, L3 `off/turn/block/delta` subscription granularity, L4 framework-free view registry, plus turn-cursor pagination. Pure TypeScript (browser-safe, no engine imports); the sole owner of the transcript contract types (`src/contract/`) and the op-batch sequencing contract. See `packages/transcript/AGENTS.md`.
- `packages/protocol`: Shared REST + WS protocol schemas (envelope, error codes, pagination, ws-control) for the nighthawk daemon.
- `packages/security-core`: Standalone security engine sources (rules, scanner, secrets, taint). **Deprecated** — production security engine lives in `packages/agent-core/src/tools/builtin/security/`; this package is retained for reference only and is not imported by any other package.
- `packages/minidb`: Embedded JSON document store (`MiniDb`) behind kap-server's search index — snapshot + WAL persistence with an exclusive write lock, a larger-than-RAM full-text layer, and persistent index generations. See `packages/minidb/AGENTS.md`.
- `packages/pi-tui`: The pi-style terminal UI component framework powering the TUI. See `packages/pi-tui/AGENTS.md`.
- `packages/tree-sitter-bash`: A pure-TypeScript bash parser (no runtime deps, no wasm); `parse(source, { timeoutMs, maxNodes })` runs under a deterministic budget and returns a discriminated `ParseResult` — callers must treat aborted/hasError trees as "cannot analyze" and degrade. Parser only, no safety judgments; see the package README's "Known differences" section.

### Supporting Packages
- `packages/acp-adapter`: ACP adapter.
- `packages/acp-server`: ACP server.
- `packages/migration-legacy`: Migration tools for legacy systems.

## Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: `>=24.15.0` (from the root `package.json` `engines`; `.nvmrc` is `24.15.0`, used by nvm / fnm / mise to pick the minimum recommended version).
- **pnpm**: `10.33.0` (from the root `package.json` `packageManager`).
- `pnpm install` will fail when the Node version is not satisfied, because `.npmrc` sets `engine-strict=true`.

## Monorepo Workspace Maintenance

- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is the source of truth for workspace membership, but `flake.nix` also contains **hardcoded** `workspacePaths` and `workspaceNames` lists.
- **Whenever you add or remove a workspace package, you MUST update both `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `flake.nix` — for every package, including leaf / test / e2e packages that nothing depends on.**
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses globs (`packages/*`, `apps/*`), so most packages land there automatically; `flake.nix` is fully manual and is where omissions happen.
  - Missing a path in `flake.nix`'s `workspacePaths` will silently drop files from the Nix build's `src` fileset.
  - Missing a name in `flake.nix`'s `workspaceNames` will break `pnpmConfigHook` because dependencies for that workspace will not be fetched.
- The automated "Check flake.nix workspace sync" (`scripts/check-nix-workspace.mjs`) only validates the transitive dependency **closure of `@nighthawk/nighthawk`**. A leaf package outside that closure (e.g. an e2e package nobody imports) slips through even when it is missing from `flake.nix`. A green check is therefore NOT proof that `flake.nix` is fully in sync — keep it updated by hand on every add/remove, do not rely on the check to catch omissions.

## General Coding Rules

- `packages/agent-core-v2`, `packages/kap-server`, and `packages/transcript` are comment-free zones: no line/block comments; the exceptions are JSDoc attached to exported symbols and load-bearing lint-suppression directives (`oxlint-disable` / `eslint-disable`), while other tooling directives (`@ts-expect-error`, …) stay banned. Enforced by `scripts/check-no-comments.mjs`, which runs as part of `pnpm lint`.
- For optional object properties, pass `undefined` directly instead of using conditional spread.
  - YES: `{ user }`
  - NO: `{ ...(user ? { user } : undefined) }`
- Optional object properties do not need to additionally allow `undefined` in the type.
  - YES: `interface Options { user?: User }`
  - NO: `interface Options { user?: User | undefined }`
- Internal methods with only a single parameter should not be turned into options objects just for stylistic uniformity.
- Except for a package's `index.ts`, other `index.ts` files should prefer `export * from './module';`.
- Do not add too many new test files. Prefer adding tests to the existing test file of the corresponding component or module.
- When a test fails because of a user modification, default to fixing the test first; do not change the implementation to satisfy an old test unless the implementation truly has a bug.
- Do not sacrifice code quality for external compatibility unless the user explicitly asks for it. Breaking changes go through changesets and a `major` bump, gated by the rule below.

## Experimental Features

- Gate a not-yet-public feature behind an experimental flag. Flags are env-driven and default off: `NIGHTHAWK_EXPERIMENTAL_<NAME>` toggles one, `NIGHTHAWK_EXPERIMENTAL_FLAG` enables all. Release by flipping the entry's `default` to `true`.
  - `packages/agent-core` (v1): add the flag to the central registry at `packages/agent-core/src/flags/registry.ts`, then check it with `flags.enabled('my-feature')`.
  - `packages/agent-core-v2` and kap-server modules: there is no central catalog — declare the flag in the owning domain via `registerFlagDefinition` at import time (see `packages/agent-core-v2/docs/flag.md`), then check it with `IFlagService.enabled(id)`. Current search-index-separation flags: `persistence_minidb_readmodel` (session read model, default on) and `search_worker` (global search worker host, default on).

## Where to Update Instructions

- Hard rules that affect almost every task: update the root `AGENTS.md`.
- Rules that only affect a specific directory: update the nearest sub-directory `AGENTS.md`.
- Project-map entries stay at 1–2 sentences; deep package docs live in the package's own `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep instruction updates focused and supported by code facts.

## Workflow Requirements

- Prefer `rg` / `rg --files` when reading code.
- When designing changes, follow existing boundaries and local patterns first.
- In public text and test data, replace real internal identifiers with neutral placeholders such as `example.com`, `example.test`, and `YOUR_API_KEY`. Before opening a PR, ask a read-only agent to audit the diff for context-specific internal identifiers.
- When creating a PR, the PR title must follow Conventional Commit style, e.g. `chore: remove legacy format commands`.
- When an AI agent opens or updates a PR, fill in `.github/pull_request_template.md` — link the related issue or explain the problem, then describe what changed. Do not leave placeholder text or submit a generic summary of the diff.
- Do not submit vague AI-generated PR text. The human author must understand the change well enough to explain the code, edge cases, and why the approach fits this repository.
- After finishing a task and before submitting a PR, you must run the `gen-changesets` skill (see `.agents/skills/gen-changesets/SKILL.md`) and generate a changeset under `.changeset/` according to its rules.
- Changesets must strictly follow the rules in `.agents/skills/gen-changesets/SKILL.md`: write one short user-facing sentence that states only what changed, and skip any change users cannot perceive.
- When generating a changeset, **never** decide on a `major` bump on your own — stop, explain, and get explicit user confirmation first; default to `minor`, fall back to `patch`. See `.agents/skills/gen-changesets/SKILL.md`.
- Prefer importing via `import ... from '#/...'`, which serves the same purpose as `import ... from '@/...'`.
- Do not commit throwaway scratch or exploratory files. Never stage:
  - Agent working notes or handoff/summary documents (e.g. `HANDOVER-*.md`, `HANDOFF-*.md`, `handoff.md`).
  - Throwaway UI/UX prototypes or design mockups (e.g. `*-designs.html`, `*-mockup.html`, `*-demo(s).html`) at the repo root or under a `design/` folder. The only tracked `.html` files should be Vite `index.html` entrypoints.
  Before committing or opening a PR, run `git status` and `git diff --staged --stat` and remove anything matching these patterns. Put scratch work under `.tmp/` (gitignored) instead of the repo root or the source tree.

# Full release process
pnpm run release
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Located in `test/` directories within each package, using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffixes
- **E2E Tests**: Located in `apps/nighthawk/test/e2e/`, run with `pnpm run e2e`
- **Smoke Tests**: Custom scripts in `scripts/` directory for security and vendor validation
- **PI-TUI Tests**: Run separately with `node:test` (not vitest) via `pnpm --filter @nighthawk/pi-tui test`

### Running Tests

```sh
# Run all tests
pnpm run test

# Run tests for a specific package
pnpm -C packages/agent-core test

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode during development
pnpm run test:watch
```

### CI Test Configuration

The CI runs tests in parallel shards (5 shards) for faster execution. Each PR triggers:
1. **Build job**: Builds all packages and runs CLI smoke test
2. **Test job**: Runs vitest across 5 parallel shards
3. **PI-TUI test job**: Runs the pi-tui test suite separately
4. **VS Code legacy test job**: Tests VS Code extension with legacy engine
5. **Lint job**: Runs oxlint and sherif checks
6. **Typecheck job**: Runs TypeScript type checking across all packages

### Writing Tests

- Prefer adding tests to existing test files rather than creating new test files
- When a test fails due to code changes, fix the test first unless the implementation has a bug
- Use vitest for unit and integration tests
- Security tools have dedicated smoke tests in `scripts/smoke-security.ts`

## Security Considerations

### Security Toolkit

NightHawk includes a comprehensive security engine with four main tools:

1. **SecurityScan**: 116+ vulnerability rules across SQLi, XSS, command injection, path traversal, SSRF, deserialization, weak crypto, auth flaws, XXE, and per-language risks
2. **SecretScan**: Detects hardcoded credentials using patterns and Shannon-entropy scoring
3. **TaintTrace**: Variable-level taint tracking tracing user-controlled sources through assignment chains to dangerous sinks
4. **DepAudit**: Flags risky dependency patterns like unpinned versions

### Security Development Rules

- Run security smoke tests after any engine change: `node scripts/smoke-security.ts`
- The security engine production code lives in `packages/agent-core/src/tools/builtin/security/`; `packages/security-core` is deprecated and retained for reference only
- Security tools are exposed as first-class agent tools that can be invoked mid-session
- Findings carry CWE/OWASP IDs, severity levels, and bilingual fix suggestions

### Secure Development Practices

- **Workspace Trust**: The startup path must not spawn child processes by bare command name before the workspace trust gate to prevent binary planting attacks
- **Command Resolution**: Use `resolveCommandPath` from `src/utils/process/resolve-command.ts` to resolve external commands with absolute paths
- **Dependency Auditing**: Run `pnpm run sherif` to check for workspace dependency issues
- **CI Security**: GitHub Actions workflows run on pull requests and pushes to main with minimal permissions

## Available Skills for Development

The project includes specialized skills in `.agents/skills/` for common development tasks:

- **agent-core-dev**: Use when developing in `packages/agent-core-v2` — adding or modifying domain services, choosing lifecycle scopes, wiring DI dependencies
- **agent-core-review**: Use for code review and test guidance in `packages/agent-core-v2`
- **gen-changesets**: Use when generating changesets for releases
- **gen-docs**: Use for updating user documentation after code changes
- **write-tui**: Use when writing or modifying the terminal UI in `apps/nighthawk/src/tui`
- **translate-docs**: Use for translating and syncing bilingual documentation
- **sync-changelog**: Use after releases to sync changelogs
- **pre-changelog**: Use before release PRs to preview changelogs

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Configuration

- **Strict Mode**: Enabled with additional strict checks (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitOverride`, etc.)
- **Module System**: ES2024 target with bundler module resolution
- **Imports**: Prefer `import ... from '#/...'` pattern (maps to `./src/*.ts`)
- **Exports**: Package `index.ts` files should use `export * from './module'` pattern

### Linting Rules

- **oxlint**: Primary linter with TypeScript-aware rules
- **Comment-free zones**: `packages/agent-core-v2`, `packages/kap-server`, and `packages/transcript` have minimal comments (only JSDoc for exports and lint suppressions)
- **Optional properties**: Pass `undefined` directly instead of conditional spread
- **Error handling**: Use `only-throw-error` rule, throw Error objects not literals

### Formatting

- Auto-formatting via `pnpm lint:fix`
- Git hooks run lint-staged on commit
- Follow existing local patterns when lint rules don't cover style choices

## Monorepo Workspace Structure

### Package Organization

- **apps/**: Application packages (CLI, VS Code extension, web inspector, visual debugger)
- **packages/**: Core engine packages (agent core, server, SDK, utilities)
- **plugins/**: Plugin marketplace configuration
- **docs/**: VitePress documentation site
- **scripts/**: Build scripts, CI checks, and security smoke tests

### Dependency Management

- Workspace dependencies use `workspace:^` protocol
- Use `pnpm run sherif` to check for workspace dependency issues
- Changesets manage versioning and changelogs for releases
- CI validates package publishing with `publint` and `attw` checks

## Additional Notes

### Nix Build Support

The project includes a `flake.nix` for reproducible builds and development environments:
- **Dev shell**: Provides Node.js, pnpm, ripgrep, and fd
- **Package build**: Builds the native SEA (Single Executable Application) binary
- **Supported platforms**: x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux, x86_64-darwin, aarch64-darwin

### Editor Configuration

- `.editorconfig`: UTF-8, LF line endings, 2-space indentation, final newline
- `.oxlintrc.json`: Comprehensive linting configuration with TypeScript, import, unicorn, promise, and node plugins

### Security Verification

To verify a checkout:
```sh
pnpm lint                                  # oxlint + repo guards
pnpm -C packages/agent-core test           # engine + security tool tests
node scripts/smoke-security.ts             # security engine end-to-end
```
