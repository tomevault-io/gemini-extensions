## Architecture at a glance

Monorepo: `backend/` (Python 3.14 FastAPI) + `frontend/` (Next.js 16 App Router) deployed via Docker Compose with PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7. The backend proxies all external services (Ollama, Kokoro, Whisper) — the frontend never calls them directly.

## Key constraints

- **Users can learn multiple languages simultaneously** — each language gets an isolated study plan, progress, flashcards, conversations, and competencies. Supported target languages: `en-US`, `en-GB`, `es-ES`, `it-IT`, `pt-PT`, `de-DE`, `fr-FR`, `ja-JP`, `ko-KR`, `zh-CN`. User's native language (asked at registration) is used for flashcard translations, tutor feedback, lesson and exercise `native_explanation` content, and cached native-language help in static grammar, phrasebook, and vocabulary resources.
- **User settings and memories are global (per user), not per language.** Profile (avatar, bio, display name, email, password, native language, UI locale), conversation limits (max duration, inactivity timeout, daily/weekly minutes, weekly sessions), token quota, subscription, and LLM memories are stored on the `users` table or keyed by `user_id` only — they do not change when switching the active study language. The `study_plan_id` column on `memories` tags each memory with the plan it was created in, but the settings page (`GET /api/memories`) lists all memories regardless of language. In chat/conversation context, memories are optionally filtered by `study_plan_id` to inject language-relevant context into the LLM prompt.
- **First registered user becomes admin automatically** when `FIRST_USER_IS_ADMIN=true` (default).
- **Registration gating**: `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` blocks public signups; admin creates users or generates single-use invite links (48h expiry in Redis).
- **Ollama should run on the host for GPU access**, accessed via `host.docker.internal:11434`. On Linux, the backend service needs `extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]`.
- **Default target language is `en-GB`** — all fallback defaults across backend (service params, Query params, model column defaults, chat context, onboarding form) and frontend (`DEFAULT_TARGET_LANGUAGE` in `target-languages.ts`) use `en-GB`. `en-US` remains a supported language but is never used as a fallback default.

## Documentation maintenance (MANDATORY)

**Any code change that affects behaviour, models, endpoints, configuration, or dependencies MUST be followed by an update to all affected spec and MD files.**

Rules that apply without exception:

1. **Proactively identify affected docs.** After every implementation change, review which of the files below are impacted and list them explicitly before closing the task.
2. **Always inform and ask for confirmation.** Before updating any spec or MD file, state exactly what will change and wait for explicit user approval. Never silently update documentation.
3. **No task is complete without docs in sync.** A feature or fix is considered unfinished if the relevant spec files, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md` have not been updated (or the user has explicitly opted out).
4. **Version and changelog.** Any user-visible change must be reflected in `CHANGELOG.md` and `specs/version.md` (with a version bump if warranted).

Files most commonly affected by code changes:

- **New/modified endpoint** — `specs/api-endpoints.instructions.md`, `specs/rate-limiting.instructions.md`
- **New/modified model or migration** — `specs/database-models.instructions.md`, `specs/architecture-backend.instructions.md`
- **New/modified service or env var** — `specs/services.instructions.md`, `specs/architecture-backend.instructions.md`, `specs/docker.instructions.md`, `README.md`
- **New/modified auth flow** — `specs/architecture.instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md` (Auth design section)
- **Study plan / lesson / progress change** — `specs/study-plan.instructions.md`, `specs/api-endpoints.instructions.md`, `specs/architecture.instructions.md`
- **Frontend component/page change** — `specs/architecture-frontend.instructions.md`
- **New phase or major feature** — `specs/phase-*.instructions.md` (create if needed), `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `specs/version.md`
- **Docker/compose change** — `specs/docker.instructions.md`, `README.md`
- **Rate limit change** — `specs/rate-limiting.instructions.md`, `specs/api-endpoints.instructions.md`
- **Version bump** — `specs/version.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `frontend/src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` (sidebar version string)

## Run order (first deployment)

1. `docker compose up -d` — start all services (DB migrations run automatically on backend startup)

## Development environment constraints

- **No Docker locally.** The development machine does not have Docker installed. Never suggest `docker` or `docker compose` commands to run locally.
- **Not deployed locally.** The application runs in a remote server; the dev machine is used only for editing and pushing code. CI/CD (GitHub Actions) builds and publishes the Docker images.
- **Cannot test the running app locally.** Validation is limited to static checks: `npx tsc --noEmit` (frontend) and `python3 -m compileall app/ alembic/ -q` (backend).
- **package-lock.json must be generated with npm 11** (the version installed locally). The Dockerfile upgrades npm to v11 before `npm ci` to stay in sync.

## Commands

```bash
# Lint & format backend
ruff check --fix backend/ && black backend/

# Lint & format frontend
npx eslint src/ --ext .ts,.tsx && npx prettier --write src/

# Run all backend tests (coverage must be ≥70%)
cd backend && pytest

# Run single test file
pytest tests/test_auth.py -v

# DB migrations (run on the remote server, not locally)
docker compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

## Validation and test accounting

- When finishing a feature or task that requires test validation, use only the `pre-push` skill for the final test run.
- If new backend tests are added, update the documented backend test count and backend coverage percentage wherever those metrics are recorded.
- If new frontend tests are added, update the documented frontend test count wherever it is recorded. Frontend coverage percentage is not tracked.
- **If any test fails, STOP and ask the user what to do.** Never modify production code or tests to make them pass without explicit user approval. Report the failures and wait for instructions.

## Auth design (do not deviate)

- `access_token` — Type: JWT HS256. Duration: 15 min. Storage: Zustand store (JS memory).
- `refresh_token` — Type: Opaque UUID4. Duration: 30 days. Storage: httpOnly cookie + Redis (`refresh:{token}` → user_id).

- Access token verified without DB hit (JWT decode only).
- Refresh tokens stored in Redis with native TTL for auto-expiry.
- **On refresh: old token deleted, new token created** (rotation + replay detection).
- Logout deletes the refresh token from Redis and clears the cookie.
- Frontend interceptor: on 401, silent refresh → retry. Redirect to `/login` if refresh fails.

## Code standards (non-default choices)

- **Python**: ruff with rules `E, W, F, I, UP, B, S, ANN` (ANN101 ignored). Black line-length 100. S and ANN rules disabled in `tests/`.
- **TypeScript**: no semicolons, single quotes, 2-space tabs, trailing commas es5. `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` required.
- **shadcn/ui** components must be installed: `button card input progress badge separator sheet tabs`.

## TTS & STT services

Both TTS and STT are always active — the app has no meaning without voice. The provider is selected per-service:

- `TTS_PROVIDER=local` → Kokoro-FastAPI (`kokoro` Docker service, GPU recommended)
- `TTS_PROVIDER=openai` → OpenAI TTS API (`OPENAI_API_KEY` required, no local service needed)
- `STT_PROVIDER=local` → faster-whisper (`whisper` Docker service, GPU recommended)
- `STT_PROVIDER=openai` → OpenAI Whisper API (`OPENAI_API_KEY` required, no local service needed)

When using `openai` providers, the `kokoro` and `whisper` Docker services can be removed from the compose stack. The `OPENAI_API_KEY` used for LLM is reused for TTS/STT.

Default STT model (local): `large-v3-turbo` via `STT_MODEL` in `.env`. Engine via `STT_ENGINE`.
Default OpenAI TTS model: `tts-1` via `OPENAI_TTS_MODEL`. Voice via `OPENAI_TTS_VOICE` (default: `nova`).
Default OpenAI STT model: `whisper-1` via `OPENAI_STT_MODEL`.
