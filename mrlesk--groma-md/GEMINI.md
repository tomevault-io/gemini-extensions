## Backlog.md Workflow

This project uses Backlog.md for task and project management.

Run `backlog instructions overview` before code work or Backlog task administration. Skip it for questions,
read-only audits, and standalone documentation changes that do not involve Backlog records.

Use the overview to decide whether to search, read, create, or update Backlog tasks.

Before task lifecycle actions, read the matching detailed guide:

- `backlog instructions task-creation` before creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog instructions task-execution` before planning, changing status or assignee, adding a plan or implementation
  notes, or implementing task work
- `backlog instructions task-finalization` before checking acceptance criteria, writing final summaries, or moving tasks
  to terminal statuses

Use `backlog <command> --help` before running unfamiliar commands. Help shows options, fields, and examples.

Do not edit Backlog task, draft, document, decision, or milestone markdown files directly. Use the `backlog` CLI so
metadata, relationships, and history stay consistent.

## IMPORTANT: Point of view

Write for a junior developer who knows the language but is new to the project and has no access to this conversation.
They should be able to find where a change belongs, follow the flow from entry point to result, and identify who owns
each responsibility. Describe the final system and its reasons, not the approaches tried.

## OKF and C4 are design foundations

When proposing or changing architecture concepts, relationships, flows, or stored knowledge, reason explicitly about
both OKF 0.2 and C4 before choosing the model.

- OKF defines how knowledge remains readable, linked, and portable. Prefer standard metadata, ordinary Markdown, and
  Markdown links. Keep Groma-specific metadata under `groma`; do not duplicate information already expressed by standard
  fields or the document body.
- C4 defines architecture levels and boundaries. Decide whether a concept is an actor, system, container, component,
  relationship, or supporting knowledge about the architecture. A new OKF concept does not automatically become a C4
  element, containment level, or box on the map.
- Groma's application profile defines the additional meaning and constraints needed by its supported behavior.
  Distinguish those rules from requirements imposed by OKF or C4.

For a relevant proposal, briefly explain:

1. Where the concept belongs in OKF and C4.
2. What an ordinary Markdown or OKF reader can understand without Groma.
3. What Groma must interpret, and which existing concept owns that meaning.

Read [the architecture Markdown contract](docs/component-markdown.md) and the relevant product documentation.
Consult the authoritative [OKF specification](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/open-knowledge-format/blob/main/SPEC.md)
or [C4 model](https://c4model.com) when the decision depends on rules those documents do not establish. Do not invent a
standard requirement or add optional metadata merely because the standard supports it.

## Test decisions across projects and languages

When making product, design, architecture, or implementation decisions, ask:

> If Groma ran against millions of projects across hundreds of programming languages, would this still be the right decision?

Use this question to identify assumptions tied to the current project, technology, workflow, or example. Prefer choices
whose reasoning remains sound across different contexts. Explain any dependence on the current context and why the
requested result requires it.

This is a test of the decision, not permission to expand the task. Implement and verify the smallest approved result for
the current supported example. Do not add infrastructure, abstractions, or capabilities solely for that
future scale. See the [manifesto principle](MANIFESTO.md#principles-that-hold-across-projects-and-languages).

## IMPORTANT: Experimental prototype

Groma is an early experimental prototype used only by its developers. It has no external users and no released data,
storage, CLI, or API contracts that must remain compatible.

Do not preserve previous versions. Do not add backward compatibility, migrations, legacy formats, compatibility adapters,
or deprecation paths unless the current user explicitly requests one. When the product direction changes, replace the old
behavior directly and delete obsolete code, documentation, tests, and prototype data.

It is acceptable to wipe and recreate all Groma-owned prototype state required by the current task instead of migrating
it. This permission applies only to explicitly scoped Groma artifacts and never to unrelated developer files or systems.


## Backlog task scope

As a project-specific override to the overview's general task-creation guidance, create Backlog tasks only when the
requested work includes code changes. Do not create a task for standalone documentation changes or Backlog record
administration, such as relabeling, status corrections, or metadata maintenance. Documentation required to deliver an
in-scope code change may remain part of that code task.

## Backlog change tracking

Update task traceability immediately after each change. Do not wait for tests,
progress notes, or task finalization, and do not batch several changes before
updating the task.

- As soon as you change a repository file for a task, and before changing
  another file, record its repository-relative path in the task's modified-file
  list. `--modified-file` replaces the complete list, so first preserve every
  existing entry, then append the newly changed path with another flag. Use
  `backlog task view TASK-N --plain` first if you do not have the current list.
  Keep one flag per file in the order the files were first changed:

  ```bash
  backlog task edit TASK-N \
    --modified-file <existing-path> \
    --modified-file <new-path>
  ```

  The web map stands the task's pin on the element whose code holds the newest
  recorded file.
- As soon as a change affects a Groma architecture element, add that element's
  exact `id` as a Backlog reference with
  `backlog task edit TASK-N --add-ref <id>`. Do this in the same immediate
  change-tracking loop, not at the end of the task. Do not use file paths as the
  join key. Only an exact element `id` produces a live marker.

## Agent coordination

Do not contact, interrupt, or otherwise disturb another agent merely because
its task is active. Compare the tasks' recorded modified-file lists first. If
the files do not overlap with the current task, proceed independently without
sending a coordination message. Coordinate only when the recorded files
overlap or when the current work is about to create a real file-level conflict.

Preserve unrelated changes made by the user or other agents. Do not revert or reformat them.

## Commit messages

When the user confirms that a task is done, commit that task's files
immediately. Stage only the files this agent changed for that task.
Do not stage files other agents changed, even if they sit nearby.

For work associated with a Backlog task, use the exact task ID and title as the commit subject:

```text
<TASK-ID> - <task title>
```

For example: `TASK-28.3 - Supply annotated architecture through Groma core`.

## Minimum sufficient product

Build the simplest real result that matches the requested outcome and any approved example. Prefer the fewest concepts,
fields, files, dependencies, and lines of code or documentation that make the requested observable result work.

Simplicity means minimum sufficient information, not vague placeholders or toy behavior. Keep concrete data the supported
flow actually needs, such as an exact source file when a code reference must be useful, and omit everything the current
result does not require. Add another field, layer, abstraction, rule, or explanation only when the requested outcome
cannot work without it.

When multiple approaches produce the same result, choose the one that is shortest and easiest to explain. Do not import
complexity from an earlier Groma implementation, a generic architecture, or a hypothetical future requirement.

Do not reduce line count at the expense of readability. Before adding a file, layer, or dependency, find the domain that
owns the behavior and reuse suitable existing concepts.

## File length

A source or test file over 500 lines is a code smell. Split it so each file stays at or under 500 lines.

## Repository checks

Run `bun run check` after the complete code change. It is the single repository check: Biome lints the supported
TypeScript files, TypeScript checks their types, and the Node and Bun test suites run. Repeat it after fixes that could
affect its result. Once required checks pass, broaden or repeat validation only for new changes, failures, or unresolved
concerns. Standalone documentation and instruction edits do not require the code test suite.

Biome uses its recommended lint rules and reports functions whose cognitive complexity is above 15. Existing complexity
warnings are cleanup targets, not permission to add more. Keep new and changed functions at or below the limit, and prefer
small domain operations over branches nested inside one large function.

Biome formatting and import assist are disabled. Do not use Biome to format files or organize imports.

## Web SVG performance

Keep viewport-sized SVG surfaces that use patterns or filters outside groups transformed by the camera. They must be
siblings of the moving camera group so pan and zoom do not repaint them together with the architecture scene. Measure
frame rate only when a rendering regression is suspected; do not make manual FPS checks routine.

## UI descriptions

Do not add subtitles, helper text, or descriptive copy beneath headings, labels, cards, or settings by default. Prefer
one concise, self-explanatory heading or label. Only add supporting copy when the user explicitly asks for it or when it
is necessary to prevent misunderstanding or error, and never use it to restate the heading.

## Product-first scope

Treat the explicit request and current task as the scope. Background, examples, and product vision help explain that
scope but do not expand it. Only the explicitly requested outcome, task acceptance criteria, project Definition of Done,
a documented contract or named invariant, a reproduced failure in the supported product flow, and an explicitly approved
example authorize implementation.

Distinguish verified facts, assumptions, recommendations, and the user's confirmed decisions. Never present an inference
as an approved requirement.

A request to investigate, explain, review, propose, or design does not authorize implementation or file changes. If
reasonable interpretations would materially change behavior, scope, cost, or complexity, report the difference to the
user/orchestrator with the evidence, tradeoff, and recommendation. Pause only the affected work while waiting for
direction. If you misread the user's direction, explain what you assumed and changed, and resolve the interpretation
before continuing the affected work.

For changes to product behavior, identify the actor, entry point, and expected result from the request, acceptance
criteria, or an approved example. For fixes and internal refactors, restore or preserve the supported behavior; no new
example is required. Ask only when a missing decision would materially change the result. Make routine implementation
choices within the approved scope and continue through implementation and verification.

For architecture, scanner, and rendering work, approved hand-authored Markdown and its rendered view are the semantic
authority. The scanner exists to reproduce that meaning from code. Files, directories, imports, line counts, framework
internals, and containment are evidence; they are not architecture components or collaborations unless the approved
example requires them.

Every new behavior, output, artifact, concept, abstraction, module, dependency, or test must answer:

> Which current user action or visible result requires this to exist?

Availability, implementation convenience, completeness, convention, best practice, future flexibility, large scale,
generic support, production safety, compatibility, and possible edge cases are not sufficient answers.

Implement one approved revision and one supported example at a time. Do not generalize to another repository, language,
framework, scale, or delivery model until the current result has been used and approved by a human.

A task is not complete merely because its tests pass. Someone unfamiliar with the implementation must be able to explain
the path from entry point through responsibilities and state to the result, and understand why each visible concept
exists.

## Groma delivery boundaries

Groma is moving toward a model that is detached from the filesystem. Treat the current filesystem integration as
temporary delivery plumbing, not as a foundation to generalize or harden for hypothetical futures.

Do not add the following behaviors outside the approved scope. If the request or acceptance criteria already require
them, proceed without asking again; compatibility and migrations still require an explicit user request. Otherwise,
report the proposal to the current user/orchestrator for approval before implementing:

- backward compatibility, migrations, or legacy behavior;
- handling for an edge case not required by an acceptance criterion or a reproduced failure in the supported product
  flow;
- fallback, retry, recovery, or degraded-mode behavior;
- filesystem or security hardening beyond the declared supported assumptions;
- an abstraction or extension point justified only by possible future needs.

The report must identify the triggering evidence, the authority that makes the work in scope, the smallest proposed
behavior, and the cost of leaving it unsupported. Tests for unapproved behavior count as implementation and require the
same approval.

Review findings may block completion only when they cite an unmet acceptance criterion, an unmet Definition of Done
item, or a reproducible failure in the declared supported product flow. Otherwise record them as non-blocking
follow-ups.

The implementing agent performs the specification and quality reviews itself. The specification review compares the
result with the task acceptance criteria and Definition of Done. The quality review checks the changed code for
reproducible defects, unnecessary complexity, unclear ownership, and missing tests in the supported flow. Do not spawn
separate agents for these reviews.

During the quality review, trace the changed flow from entry point to result as a junior developer new to the project.
Check whether they can find where the behavior lives and where a similar change belongs, follow data and control flow,
and understand ownership and correct use from names and contracts without knowing hidden conventions.

The first specification and quality reviews may inspect the complete change. Any re-review is limited to the previously
reported findings and regressions caused by their fixes. Newly noticed non-critical improvements are follow-ups.

Stop work when the supported product flow passes, the task acceptance criteria and Definition of Done are satisfied with
evidence, and no authority-backed blocking finding remains.

## Simplicity review

For substantial domain or architecture changes, or when explicitly requested, run one cold simplicity review after
implementation and focused checks pass, before specification, quality, and finalization reviews. Small fixes,
behavior-preserving refactors, and documentation changes use the implementer's own review unless external review is
explicitly requested.

Give the reviewer the task, the diff, and the repository without conversation history. The reviewer must briefly explain
the implemented flow from its entry point through its work to its result, then answer:

1. Is this the simplest implementation that satisfies the acceptance criteria?
2. What code, concepts, indirection, or tests can be deleted or collapsed?
3. Can someone unfamiliar with the codebase quickly understand the flow?

Findings may recommend deletion, consolidation, naming improvements, or clarification within the accepted scope. They
may not introduce behavior, requirements, edge cases, compatibility, fallback, recovery, hardening, or future
abstractions.

The implementer applies accepted simplifications and reruns focused checks. There may be at most one targeted re-review,
limited to the original simplicity findings and regressions caused by their fixes. The implementer's specification and
quality reviews follow only after this gate passes.

## Full-context complexity review

For the same substantial changes, or when explicitly requested, run one final review in a separate agent with the full
conversation context after the implementer's specification and quality reviews. Check whether the result could use a
simpler approach, whether components are grouped clearly by domain, and whether ownership and supported usage are clear.
Present material recommendations to the user before changing the architecture beyond the approved scope.

The cold simplicity review and the full-context complexity review are the only reviews assigned to separate agents.
Do not spawn agents for other reviews unless the user explicitly asks.

## Tests

Test domain rules and observable behavior: scanner inference, ownership, navigation state, projection and layout
invariants, camera rules, world immutability, and lifecycle.

Before adding a test or extending its assertions, inspect existing coverage and briefly record in the task plan:

1. The supported rule and its authority: the user request, an accepted requirement, a documented contract, or a
   reproduced failure in the supported flow.
2. The concrete incorrect result the test would detect.
3. The gap in existing coverage and the smallest test needed to close it.

One short explanation per behavior is enough. If you cannot name the specific failure and the coverage gap, do not add
the test. Prefer extending relevant coverage over duplicating the same check across files or layers. An agent-written
acceptance criterion saying "tests cover this" does not by itself justify a test; it must trace to the supported rule.

Zero new tests is a valid outcome. Copy, styling, documentation, and behavior-preserving cleanup do not automatically
need new tests. Use existing checks and focused manual verification when they are sufficient.

Do not add tests of documentation inventories, source-code text, decorative details (frame strings, hint text, border
glyphs, colors), or exact prose. A minimal text anchor may observe behavior, and exact command arguments or protocol
values may be checked when required by a contract; do not freeze the surrounding wording. Never merely restate a
fixture or copy the implementation into the expected result. For example, an owner-selection test must identify the
correct owner, not just find the heading "Owner".

During the implementer's quality review, check that each new or changed test proves its claimed behavior: would the
concrete wrong result fail, and would a harmless wording change or behavior-preserving refactor still pass? Remove or
improve assertions that fail this review. For bug fixes, verify that the regression test fails before the fix and passes
after it when practical.

Automated tests load architecture only from `test/fixtures/`, never from the live `groma/` tree. A fixture is a
minimum world that exhibits the rule under test: kinds, parentage, relationship direction, promotion, inset, camera.
Do not photocopy this repository's observed architecture. Do not assert product names, descriptions, file layout,
or that a particular person uses a particular system or container. If the fixture already says A uses B, do not
write a test whose only claim is that A uses B.

Tests must be parallel-safe and run concurrently (`test.concurrent` under `bun:test`). Each test owns its renderer,
fixtures, and temp directories; nothing is shared between tests. When a test needs a text anchor to observe behavior,
prefer one minimal anchor over exhaustive content matching.

## Test runner validation

- When changing test execution or lifecycle APIs, check the official documentation for the installed runner version
  and compare it with the version declared by the project.
- Distinguish concurrency within a file from parallel execution and isolation between files. Validate new runner
  options before adding them to the repository check.
- If a test passes alone but fails in the suite, investigate the difference. Do not remove assertions, narrow the
  scenario, increase timeouts, or add retries merely to obtain a passing result.

## TUI map

For TUI behavior or rendering work, read [TUI map validation](docs/viewers/tui/validation.md) and use its
`tui-test` procedure to verify the affected flow.

<!-- groma:start -->
## Groma

This project uses Groma. Run `groma agent-instructions` when scanning or curating architecture, or changing scanner or
architecture-model behavior. Do not edit Groma-owned architecture files directly.
