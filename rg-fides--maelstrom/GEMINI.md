# Base AI Instructions

**Scope**: Universal guidelines for all personas. Persona-specific instructions override these if conflicts arise.

## Core Principles

- **Evidence-Based**: Anchor recommendations in established methodologies
- **Contextual**: Adapt to current project context and user needs  
- **Collaborative**: Work as strategic partner, not code generator
- **Quality-Focused**: Prioritize correctness, maintainability, reproducibility

## Boundaries

- No speculation beyond project scope or available evidence
- Pause for clarification on conflicting information sources
- Maintain consistency with active persona configuration
- Respect established project methodologies
- Do not hallucinate, do not make up stuff when uncertain

## File Conventions

- **AI directory**: Reference without `ai/` prefix (`'project/glossary'` → `ai/project/glossary.md`)
- **Extensions**: Optional (both `'project/glossary'` and `'project/glossary.md'` work)
- **Commands**: See `./ai/docs/commands.md` for authoritative reference

## Operational Guidelines

### Efficiency Rules

- **Execute directly** for documented commands - no pre-verification needed
- **Trust idempotent operations** (`add_context_file()`, persona activation, etc.)
- **Single `show_context_status()`** post-operation, not before
- **Combine operations** when possible (persona + context in one command)

## MD Style Guide

Formatting and linting rules for all Markdown files are maintained in
`.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md`, which the IDE applies automatically
to any `.md` file in the repository.

## Agent Routing

Consult your current agentic system documentation (e.g. .github/migration.md, .github/agent-architecture.md)

### Cache Manifest (from `./data-public/metadata/CACHE-manifest.md`)

# CCHS Pipeline — CACHE Manifest

This document describes the analysis-ready dataset produced by `manipulation/2-ellis.R`.
It is the authoritative reference for downstream analyses in `analysis/`.

> **Status**: Populated — statistics refreshed from `2-ellis.R` run 2026-05-20
> (after SDCFIMM fix; data-primer-1 extension adds 4 facilitating vars + ADL rename + work_stress). All 24 tests passing.

## Output Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| SQLite database | `data-private/derived/cchs-2.sqlite` |
| Table name | `cchs_analytic` |
| Parquet file | `data-private/derived/cchs-2-tables/cchs_analytic.parquet` |
| Sample flow table | `cchs-2.sqlite` (table: `sample_flow`) + `sample_flow.parquet` |
| Unit of observation | One row per CCHS respondent |

| Analytic n (unweighted) | 63,843 |
| Weighted N (sum of `wts_m_pooled`) | 17,844,913 |
| CCHS cycles pooled | 2010-2011 and 2013-2014 |

## Sample Construction

Sample exclusion was applied in the following order (see `sample_flow` table):

| Step | Criterion | n remaining | n excluded |
|------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 0 | Full pooled sample (2010 + 2014) | 126,431 | — |
| 1 | Age 15–75 (DHHGAGE codes 2–15) | 112,352 | 14,079 |
| 2 | Employed in past 3 months (`LOP_015 = 1`) | 64,248 | 48,104 |
| 3 | Exclude proxy respondents (`ADM_PRX = 1`) | 64,248 | 0 |
| 4 | Complete outcome data (all 8 LOP components) | **63,843** | 405 |

> **Note:** Steps 5 and 6 in the Ellis script (completeness of CCC indicators
> and key predictors) create flags (`flag_complete_ccc`, `flag_complete_predictors`,
> `flag_analytic_complete`) without excluding rows. They are not recorded in the
> `sample_flow` table.

Reference final n from the initial exploration of the data: **64,141**.
Observed n: **63,843** — deviation of 298 rows (within the ±5,000 warning threshold).

## Survey Weights

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `wts_m` | Original master weight from Statistics Canada PUMF |
| `wts_m_pooled` | Pooling-adjusted weight = `wts_m / 2` (two cycles pooled) |

> **Bootstrap weights**: Not available for CCHS 2010 and 2014 PUMF. Variance
> estimates must rely on master weight only. This is a known limitation.

## Outcome Variable

| Column | Description | Range | Missing |
|--------|-------------|-------|---------|
| `days_absent_total` | Total workdays absent in past 3 months (any health reason) | 0–63 (cap 90) | None |
| `days_absent_chronic` | Workdays absent due to chronic condition only | 0–31 (cap 90) | None |

**Construction formula**:

```text
days_absent_total = lopg040 + lopg070 + lopg082 + lopg083 +
                    lopg084 + lopg085 + lopg086 + lopg100
```

**Reference from the initial exploration of the data** (Table 2):

- Mean = 1.35 (SE = 0.02)
- Zero proportion = 70.59%
- Variance = 17.7 / SD = 4.19

**Observed in this run** (2026-05-20):

| Statistic | `days_absent_total` | `days_absent_chronic` |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Mean (unweighted) | 1.35 | 0.414 |
| Zero proportion | 70.49% | 94.32% |
| Max observed | 63 | 31 |
| Missing (NA) | 0 | 0 |

## Survey / Cycle Variables

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `cchs_cycle` | Integer: 0 = 2010-2011, 1 = 2013-2014 |
| `cchs_cycle_f` | Factor: "2010-2011", "2013-2014" |

## Completeness Flags

| Column | Description | n TRUE |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `flag_complete_ccc` | All 17 chronic condition indicators non-NA | 42,064 |
| `flag_complete_predictors` | All key predictor variables non-NA | 59,309 |
| `flag_analytic_complete` | Both CCC and predictor flags TRUE | 39,702 |

> **Note:** These flags allow analysts to subset for fully complete cases without
> re-running exclusion logic. Rows with `flag_analytic_complete == FALSE` are
> retained in the file for sensitivity analysis.

## Usage Notes for Analysts

- All factor levels are explicitly defined; do not rely on integer codes.
- Perceived health variables are recoded from raw CCHS codes (1 = best, 5 = worst)
  to labelled factors. Output columns are `health_perceived` (source: `GEN_01`),
  `mental_health_perceived` (source: `GEN_02B`), and `health_vs_prior_year`
  (source: `GEN_02`). Excellent / Much better is the first factor level in each.
- `work_stress` (source: `GEN_09`) is an ordered factor with 5 levels from
  "Not at all stressful" to "Extremely stressful". Note: this captures
  self-perceived general work stress (not specifically job demands).
- ADL limitation columns (`adl_meals`, `adl_errands`, `adl_housework`,
  `adl_personal_care`, `adl_moving_indoors`, `adl_finances`) are "No"/"Yes"
  factors. Prevalence of "Yes" is very low (~0.8%) in this employed sample.
- `smoking_status` collapses SMKDSTY's 6 codes to 4 groups: Daily, Occasional
  (codes 2+3), Former (codes 4+5), Never smoked.
- `occupation_category` uses 2010 descriptive labels for both cycles; 2014 PUMF
  labels the same 5 groups only as "GROUP 1"–"GROUP 5".
- The 17 `cc_*` columns are logical. Use `as.integer(cc_*)` to get 0/1 for
  regression models.
- Always use `wts_m_pooled` (not `wts_m`) for weighted analyses.
- No bootstrap weights are available; report confidence intervals from survey
  design-based variance or note this limitation in publications.
- CCHS PUMF terms of use: results may not be published without review per your
  data sharing agreement with Statistics Canada.

### Project Glossary (from `ai/project/glossary.md`)

# Glossary

Core terms for standardizing project communication.

---

## Data Pipeline Terminology

### Pattern

A reusable solution template for common data pipeline tasks. Patterns define the structure, philosophy, and constraints for a category of operations. Examples: Ferry Pattern, Ellis Pattern.

### Lane

A specific implementation instance of a pattern within a project. Lanes are numbered to indicate approximate execution order. Examples: `0-ferry-IS.R`, `1-ellis-customer.R`, `3-ferry-LMTA.R`.

### Ferry Pattern

Data transport pattern that moves data between storage locations with minimal/zero semantic transformation. Like a "cargo ship" - carries data intact. 

- **Allowed**: SQL filtering, SQL aggregation, column selection
- **Forbidden**: Column renaming, factor recoding, business logic
- **Input**: External databases, APIs, flat files
- **Output**: CACHE database (staging schema), parquet backup

### Ellis Pattern
 
Data transformation pattern that creates clean, analysis-ready datasets. Named after Ellis Island - the immigration processing center where arrivals are inspected, documented, and standardized before entry.

- **Required**: Name standardization, factor recoding, data type verification, missing data handling, derived variables
- **Includes**: Minimal EDA for validation (not extensive exploration)
- **Input**: CACHE staging (ferry output), flat files, parquet
- **Output**: CACHE database (project schema), WAREHOUSE archive, parquet files
- **Documentation**: Generates CACHE-manifest.md


---

## General Terms

### Artifact
Any generated output (report, model, dataset) subject to version control.

### Seed
Fixed value used to initialize pseudo-random processes for reproducibility.

### Persona
A role-specific instruction set shaping AI assistant behavior.

### Memory Entry
A logged observation or decision stored in project memory files.

### CACHE-manifest
Documentation file (`./data-public/metadata/CACHE-manifest.md`) describing analysis-ready datasets produced by Ellis pattern. Includes data structure, transformations applied, factor taxonomies, and usage notes.

### INPUT-manifest
Documentation file (`./data-public/metadata/INPUT-manifest.md`) describing raw input data before Ferry/Ellis processing.

### Pipeline Orchestra

Single-agent automation system (`@pipeline-engineer`) that guides the development, validation, and maintenance of data pipeline scripts and their companion documentation. Operates in four phases: Discovery + Ferry, Ellis Development, Validation + Documentation, Quality Audit. Design document at `.github/pipeline-orchestra.md`.

### Pipeline Artifact

One of seven tightly coupled files that define the data pipeline: `0-extract-metadata.R`, `1-ferry.R`, `2-ellis.R`, `3-test-ellis-cache.R`, `INPUT-manifest.md`, `CACHE-manifest.md`, `pipeline.md`. All must stay in sync.

### White-List (Two-Tier)

Variable selection strategy used in Ellis scripts. **CONFIRMED** (Tier 1) variables cause a hard error if missing. **INFERRED** (Tier 2) variables produce a warning and are gracefully dropped. Allows pipelines to run despite confidentiality suppressions in PUMF data.
