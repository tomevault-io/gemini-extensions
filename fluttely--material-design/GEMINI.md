## What this package is

`material_design` is a **Material Design 3 design contract** for Flutter, published on
pub.dev. It is not a component library and not a loose bag of constants: it expresses
the official M3 scales (spacing, shape, type, motion, elevation, opacity, …) as Dart
**types**, so that an app consuming it adheres to the M3 spec by construction.

Three principles define every API decision:

1. **Primitive replacement.** Public APIs accept M3 extension types
   (`M3SpacingValue`, `M3CornerValue`, `M3BorderWidthValue`, `M3OpacityValue`,
   `M3IconSizeValue`, `M3BreakpointValue`, `M3ElevationDpValue`, `M3ZIndexValue`,
   `M3ToneValue`) instead of bare `double`/`int`. No scale may quietly accept a raw
   number.
2. **No token that must be unwrapped to be used.** Scalar tokens are `static const`
   values used directly (`M3Spacings.s16`), never enums with a `.value` getter —
   the unwrap costs `const`-ness. Enums remain correct for **composite tokens**
   (`M3Motion`, `M3Elevation` — you read two fields together) and **selectors**
   (`M3ScreenSize`, `M3InteractionState` — they name a situation, not a value).
3. **Deviation is deliberate and greppable.** Extension types are erased at runtime;
   a cast always defeats them. The single sanctioned escape hatch is `M3Contract.*`
   (`M3Contract.spacing(18)` etc.). Never add a second way to smuggle an off-scale
   value in, and never use `M3Contract` inside the package itself.

Any new API must state which M3 spec section it implements (link to the
https://m3.material.io/ page in its doc comment) and use only spec values.

## Scope boundary (decided, not up for re-litigation)

**This package does not ship Material Design 3 components.** Flutter's Material
library owns `FilledButton`, `NavigationBar`, `Menu`, and the rest. A second
implementation here becomes migration debt for every consumer the day Flutter changes
its own. What the package ships is the contract those components are built from —
tokens, scales, wrappers, and the per-component *measurements* (`M3ButtonHeights` and
friends in the component token layer).

The single exception: an M3 Expressive widget Flutter does not have yet
(`M3ELoadingIndicator` today). Each such widget is a stopgap, marked `@experimental`,
and is removed once Flutter ships the real one. Do **not** implement the 2025
Expressive components (button groups, split button, FAB menu, toolbars) while
flutter/flutter#168813 is in flight — re-evaluate each release instead.

Before adding any widget, ask: does Flutter already have this, or is it about to? If
either answer is yes, ship the tokens and stop.

## Repository layout

| Path | Role | Tracked? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lib/` | The package. `material_design.dart` is a pure export barrel over `lib/src/*.dart` module barrels. | git + pub |
| `test/` | Package tests, mirroring `lib/src/` structure. | git, not pub |
| `example/` | **Single-file** consumer example (`example/lib/main.dart`). Rendered by pub.dev. Intentionally one file so a reader can copy-paste it whole. Never split it into multiple files. | git; pub keeps only `lib/` + `pubspec.yaml` |
| `demo/` | Full Flutter web app — the live, interactive showcase deployed to GitHub Pages (https://fluttely.github.io/material_design/). Every destination has two pages: the token family rendered (`showcase_pages/`) and the code that produces it (`recipe_pages/`). | git, not pub |
| `documentation/material_design/` | Obsidian vault: design notes, M3 reference docs, roadmap/plan. Bilingual: `en_US/` is the source of truth, `pt_BR/` mirrors it. | git, not pub |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file — the reasoning behind the API decisions and the working rules. | git, not pub |
| `tool/` | The verification gate. `verify.sh` runs everything; `check_triad.dart`, `check_changelog.dart` and `check_context.dart` enforce the rules below that no compiler can. | git, not pub |
| `.claude/` | Agent-facing context: `hooks/` (format-on-write, git guard), `commands/` (`/new-scale`, `/release`, `/verify`) and `skills/` (`commit`). Tracked — it is shared project context, not personal config. Only `settings.local.json` stays local. | git, not pub |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI: `tests.yml` (runs `./tool/verify.sh` on PRs to `main`), `deploy-demo.yml` (builds `demo/` web to gh-pages). | git |

### Module architecture

Nine modules with a one-directional dependency graph:

```text
tokens ──┬─> shape ──┬─> interaction
         ├─> layout ─┤
         ├─> color ──┴─> adaptive
         └─> typography
motion  ─────────────────> interaction, adaptive
expressive (standalone)
```

- Never introduce a dependency that runs against this graph.
- The token layer is deliberately **one Dart library** (`lib/src/tokens.dart` with its
  files): the type-safe wrappers rely on library-private constructors to keep
  off-scale values out. Splitting it would force those constructors public.
- Every other module boundary is real: internals stay internal, cross-module access
  goes through the module barrel.
- `lib/src/m3e/` (expressive) is the experimental M3 Expressive area; mark its public
  surface `@experimental`.

## The documentation triad (README ↔ example ↔ demo)

These three artifacts must never drift apart. Any PR that changes the public API must
update all three in the same PR:

- **README.md** — the reference: every public API family appears, clear and direct,
  with short copy-pasteable snippets. The large showcase snippet in the README is
  compiled verbatim by `test/readme_showcase_test.dart`; if you edit one, edit the
  other in the same commit, character for character.
- **example/lib/main.dart** — one runnable file demonstrating the same API families
  in the same order as the README sections. It exists for copy-paste; keep it a
  single file, keep it compiling, prefer `const`, no third-party dependencies.
- **demo/** — the live proof, in two readings of the same subject. Every token family
  and widget the package exports has a **showcase page** (what it looks like) and a
  **code page** (what you type to get it), reached by one `Visual / Code` switch. New
  API ⇒ both, in the matching section (Expressive / Foundations / Styles / Utilities
  — see "Demo conventions").

An API change lands in nine artifacts, from `lib/` through to the vault in both
languages. `/new-scale` is that checklist as a command; it carries the list so this
file does not have to.

**This rule is enforced, not remembered.** `dart run tool/check_triad.dart` fails when
a scale is missing from any of the three, when the section orders disagree, or when a
UI string names an API that no longer exists in `lib/`. It was written after the rule
had been prose for six releases and the triad had drifted anyway: nine scales were
undocumented in at least one artifact, the README was missing two whole sections, and
a demo caption advertised a class called `M3EShapeBorders` that never existed. If you
find yourself about to *silence* the checker, you are about to recreate that.

### The canonical section order

README ("API tour"), `example/lib/main.dart`, and the demo all present the API in the
same order — when adding a family, slot it consistently in all three. The order itself
is `canonicalSections` in `tool/check_triad.dart`, which is the source of truth and is
also what checks the three artifacts against it. It used to be transcribed here too;
a list kept in two places is a list that disagrees with itself eventually, and the copy
without a checker under it is the one that goes stale.

A family added to an existing area gets a `b` suffix rather than renumbering
everything after it — renumbering churns three files and every cross-reference for no
reader benefit.

### Demo conventions

- Navigation sections, in rail order: **Expressive / Foundations / Styles / Utilities**.
  Expressive leads on purpose — it is the newest part of the spec and the part a
  visitor is least likely to know exists, so it gets the position that costs no
  scrolling. The machine-readable copy is `canonicalDemoSections` in
  `tool/check_triad.dart`; change both together.
- **Adding a page is one edit.** `demo/lib/showcase/showcase_destinations.dart` pairs
  every destination with **both** of its pages and groups them into sections; the rail
  (`showcase_rail.dart`), the drawer (`showcase_drawer.dart`) and the shell
  (`showcase_shell.dart`) all derive from that list. Never reintroduce a parallel
  page list addressed by index arithmetic — that was the 1.6.0 `main.dart`.
- `demo/test/showcase_navigation_test.dart` renders every page in the list — both
  modes — so a page that throws on build fails CI rather than the deploy. It is
  written to be **order-independent**: it reads the selected destination off
  `showcaseDestinations` rather than naming it, scrolls the rail before tapping, and
  pumps bounded frames instead of `pumpAndSettle` (several pages animate forever).
  Reordering the rail must never fail a test about state layers — keep it that way.

#### The two modes

Every destination has two pages, selected by `ShowcaseMode` in the shell:

| Mode | Page | Lives in |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `visual` | the token family, rendered | `demo/lib/showcase_pages/` |
| `code` | the same family as the calls that produce it | `demo/lib/recipe_pages/` |

- **A new destination ships both.** `ShowcaseDestination.codePage` is required, and
  two model tests enforce that the 23 pairs are distinct — a code page reused across
  two destinations looks completely correct in the rail.
- **A code page is a list, not a layout.** It is `RecipePage(title:, summary:,
  groups:)` over `RecipeGroup`/`CodeRecipe`, and nothing else; the card, the preview
  surface, the highlighting and the import line are decided once in
  `demo/lib/recipes/`. Keep recipes short — three to six per page, a dozen lines of
  code each. A recipe that needs more is two recipes, or belongs on the Visual page.
- **The page title is the destination label**, rendered as `<label> · Code`, and the
  render test asserts it. That is what tells a reader who switched modes that they
  are still in the same place.
- **Groups mirror the Visual page's sections**, in the same order, so switching modes
  never reshuffles the subject.
- **Snippets are strings, so the dead-name check reads them.** That is deliberate:
  `tool/check_triad.dart` scans demo string literals for `M3*` identifiers that no
  longer exist, which is the only thing standing between a renamed API and a snippet
  that teaches the old name. It earned its keep on the first run over these pages.
- Syntax colours come from the ambient `ColorScheme` (`recipes/dart_syntax.dart`), not
  from a vendored theme — the demo restyles with the seed, and so must its code.
- The demo must *model* the contract it showcases: no raw `BorderRadius.circular`,
  literal opacities, or magic sizes in demo code — use the package's own tokens
  (deviations only via `M3Contract`, visibly).
- Never render a removed API name in a UI string (pre-1.0 the headings advertised
  deleted `M3*Token` enums for months because no compiler checks strings).
- Deploys happen only via `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml`; there is no manual
  deploy script.

## Commits

Two rules, both of which spent releases as prose and are now refused by
`.claude/hooks/guard-git.sh` before the call runs:

- **Never add AI attribution.** No `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...` trailer, no
  `🤖 Generated with Claude Code` line in a PR body. Every commit, amend, rebase and
  squash, without exception — **including when a tool's own default template suggests
  otherwise**, which is the only reason the rule needs writing down. The authorship of
  a commit here is the human who made it; the message describes the change, nothing else.
- **Never `git add -A` / `git add .`** (or `git commit -a`) while other work is in
  flight. Stage the paths that belong to the change. A sweep picks up scratch files,
  half-finished work and files another task is mid-edit on, and the mistake is invisible
  until someone reads the diff. Fix an unpushed one with `git rm --cached <path>` +
  `git commit --amend --no-edit`.

Day-to-day work happens on `dev`; `main` receives PRs and is what CI gates and the demo
deploy run against. Never commit directly to `main`.

The message format and the full checklist live in the `commit` skill
(`.claude/skills/commit/`), loaded when a commit is being written rather than carried in
every call. In short: a release commit takes the version as its subject and its body
**is** the new changelog section verbatim; everything else is Conventional Commits
(`feat!:`, `refactor!:`, `test:`, `chore:`) with `!` marking a break.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` follows Keep a Changelog + SemVer, newest section first. The emoji
taxonomy and the entry template are in the `commit` skill; three things hold always:

- **The entry ships with the change, not with the release.** A commit that changes
  anything a consumer can observe bumps `pubspec.yaml` to the next version and writes
  its `CHANGELOG.md` section in the same commit; later commits extend that open section
  until the release commit ships it. Writing the changelog at release time meant
  reconstructing months of reasoning from commit subjects, which is the one moment the
  reasoning is no longer at hand. The open section is the one version allowed to be
  documented-but-unpublished, so `check_changelog.dart` already accepts it.
- **Entries are why-first.** A short paragraph of context when the reason isn't obvious,
  then `- **Bold lead**: what changed and the reasoning.` Never a bare "Updated X".
  Breaking changes always ship with a migration mapping (old name → new name), in a
  table when there are several.
- **The changelog must match pub.dev exactly.** Every published version has a section,
  and no section exists for a version that was not published. Both directions have been
  violated: `0.0.1`–`0.8.0` and `0.29.0-dev`–`1.0.0-dev.10` shipped undocumented, while
  `1.0.0-dev.34`/`.35` had sections for builds nobody could install. The only version
  allowed to be documented-but-unpublished is the one in `pubspec.yaml`. A release that
  bundles several milestones gets **one** section covering all of them.

```sh
dart run tool/check_changelog.dart            # add --offline to skip the network
```

## Versioning & releases

- SemVer. Pre-releases use the `-dev.N` series (`1.6.0-dev.1`, `-dev.2`, …) and are
  collapsed into one narrative section when the stable version ships.
- `pubspec.yaml` `version:`, the top `CHANGELOG.md` section, and the release commit
  subject must always agree.
- **Post-1.0 breaking policy (as of 2026-08: decided by the owner):** `1.0.0` has no
  external users yet, so breaking changes are still acceptable and ship **without
  deprecation shims** — remove the old API outright and document the migration in the
  changelog. Do not add `@Deprecated` anything. Revisit this policy once the package
  has real adopters.
- **Breaking changes take a minor bump while that policy holds.** `1.6.0` shipped
  breaking renames deliberately. The reasoning: `0.28.1` went straight to `1.0.0`, so
  nobody is on `1.x`, and spending `2.0.0` on cleanup that no one has to migrate
  through would misstate the package's maturity permanently. Once there are real
  adopters, breaking changes take a major. Say so in the release notes whenever a
  minor carries a break, so the choice reads as deliberate.
- **Never write a changelog section for a version that was not published.** The
  `1.0.0-dev.*` series was never released — `0.28.1` went directly to `1.0.0` — so
  those sections were folded into `1.0.0` rather than left implying releases that
  never existed. A changelog documents what shipped, not the path taken to it.
- SDK floor: Flutter `>=3.27.0` / Dart `>=3.6.0` (needs `Color.withValues`, `Color.a`,
  `toARGB32`, extension types). Do not raise it without a changelog entry explaining
  which API forces the bump; never lower it below what the code uses.
- Packaging: `.pubignore` keeps the published archive small (~134 KB) — `demo/`,
  `documentation/`, and native runners under `example/` never ship to pub. If you add
  a new top-level directory, decide its `.pubignore` fate in the same commit.

## Code style

- Lints: `very_good_analysis` (see `analysis_options.yaml`). CI enforces
  `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` — run `dart format .` before committing.
- `const` everywhere it is possible; the contract's value proposition includes
  compile-time allocation. A change that breaks `const`-ness of an existing API is a
  breaking change.
- Public API names are prefixed `M3` (stable spec) or `M3E` (expressive/experimental).
- Every public symbol has a doc comment; non-obvious ones cite the M3 spec URL and the
  dp/ms/percentage values they encode.
- Token classes follow the pattern: `abstract final class M3Xs` (plural) holding
  `static const` values typed as the `M3XValue` extension type, plus a
  `static const List<M3XValue> values` list for galleries and property tests.
- Tests mirror `lib/src/` paths under `test/src/`. New token scales get: spec-value
  assertions, ordering assertions, and inclusion in the `values` list test.

## Verification before any commit

```sh
./tool/verify.sh              # everything; --fast skips the demo, --offline skips pub.dev
```

Or `/verify`, which runs it and acts on the result. It is one script rather than a
list of commands because `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs **the same script** — CI
and local cannot disagree about what the gate is. The steps, in order:

| Gate | What it protects |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dart format --set-exit-if-changed` | CI fails on unformatted code. The `.claude/` hook also formats every Dart file on write, so this should never be what fails. |
| `flutter analyze` | Zero issues, tree-wide. No longer disabled in CI — do not disable it again. |
| `flutter test` | Package tests, including `readme_showcase_test.dart`, which compiles the README's showcase snippet verbatim. |
| `tool/check_triad.dart` | README ↔ example ↔ demo: section order, scale coverage, dead API names in UI strings, and that every scale cites the M3 page it implements (`--trace` prints scale → spec → `file:line`). |
| `tool/check_changelog.dart` | `CHANGELOG.md` ↔ `pubspec.yaml` ↔ pub.dev. |
| `tool/check_context.dart` | The agent context window, by ring — see "Agent harness". |
| `cd example && flutter analyze` | The single-file example must always compile. |
| `cd demo && flutter analyze && flutter test` | Every showcase page renders; a page that throws fails here, not in the deploy. |

Nothing in this table is a judgement call. That is deliberate — the rules that need
judgement are in the sections above, and the rules that do not should not be costing
anyone attention.

## Agent harness

The work in this repository is done with an agent, so the agent gets the same treatment
the package gives its consumers: make the correct thing structural, make deviation
visible. Three layers, and only the third used to exist.

| When | Mechanism | Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| before | `permissions` in `settings.json`; each command's `allowed-tools` | narrows what can run at all |
| before | `hooks/guard-git.sh` (PreToolUse) | **refuses** — exits 2, the call never happens |
| during | `hooks/format-dart.sh` (PostToolUse) | formats every Dart file on write |
| after | `tool/verify.sh`, and `tests.yml` running the same script | blocks the merge |

A warning nobody must act on is not a harness. Only the rows that stop something count.

**Model floor.** `/verify`, `/new-scale` and `/release` pin `model: opus`. That is a
floor, not a spread across tiers: all three are judgement work, and **verification never
runs on a model weaker than the generator.** A reviewer that cannot follow the code
approves out of incompetence, which is worse than no review because it manufactures
confidence. Pin a cheaper tier only on a command that is genuinely mechanical — there
is none yet, and saying so is more honest than inventing one.

**Context rings.** Context is a quality variable, not only a cost: an inflated window
dilutes the signal, loses the middle, and accumulates contradictions. So the ring every
call pays for — this file — is budgeted by `tool/check_context.dart`, the on-demand ring
(`commands/`, `skills/`) is budgeted per body, and everything else is retrieved by grep
and left unbudgeted at ~58× the size of this file. When a rule here is really a
procedure, move it to a skill instead of growing this file; that is where the commit
checklist went.

## documentation/material_design (Obsidian vault)

- Structure: `en_US/` and `pt_BR/` mirror each other file-for-file; write English
  first, then translate. Internal links use Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]`.
- The vault holds three kinds of content: **reference** (M3 concepts mapped to package
  API), **maps** (`maps/Token Map.md`, `maps/Coverage Map.md`), and **plan**
  (`Roadmap.md` — the living gap analysis against https://m3.material.io/ and the
  phased action plan; API-hygiene debt lives in its Phase 0).
- Layout per locale: `Material Design 3.md` (home) + `Roadmap.md` at the root;
  `foundations/` (Foundations, Design Tokens, Accessibility, Adaptive Design,
  Interaction States); `styles/` (Styles, Color, Typography, Shape, Elevation,
  Motion); `expressive/M3 Expressive.md`; `maps/`; `implementation/Implementation.md`.
- When implementing a roadmap item, update its status in the plan in the same session,
  and keep the coverage maps in sync with the real exported API — the maps must use
  current API names (post-1.0 style: `M3Spacings.s16`, never `M3SpacingToken.space16`).
- **The vault is tracked in git as of 1.8.0** and belongs in the commit that changes
  what it describes, like any other documentation. It is still excluded from the pub
  archive by `.pubignore` — it is contributor material, not consumer material.
  `.obsidian/workspace.json` stays ignored: it is per-machine editor layout that
  changes every time the vault is opened.
