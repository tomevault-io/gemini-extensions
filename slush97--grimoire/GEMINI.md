# Grimoire

Mod manager and companion tool for Deadlock (Valve hero shooter). Electron desktop app (Windows/Linux).

## What It Does

- **Browse & Install Mods** from GameBanana (download queue, archive extraction for ZIP/7Z/RAR)
- **Import GameBanana Collections** by URL
- **One-Click Install** via custom protocol handler (`gb1click://`)
- **Catalog Sync** - background mirror of the GameBanana mod index into local SQLite for fast offline browse + FTS5 search
- **Manage Installed Mods** - enable/disable, reorder priority, delete
- **Hero Locker** - organize cosmetic skins by hero
- **Crosshair Designer** - real-time preview, save/load presets, apply to autoexec
- **Autoexec Manager** - console command editor for autoexec.cfg
- **Mod Profiles** - save/switch mod configurations
- **Portable Profile Export/Import** - share profiles via `mp1:` share codes or `.modprofile.json` files (Grimoire-only format; see `docs/profile-spec.md`)
- **Conflict Detection** - identify overlapping file paths between mods
- **Player Stats** - MMR tracking, match history, hero stats, leaderboards (via deadlock-api.com)
- **Deadworks Server Browser** - browse/join community dedicated servers; auto-downloads required map/addon content before connecting (gated behind `experimentalDeadworksServers`; see `docs/deadworks-servers.md`)
- **Auto-Update** - GitHub releases integration

## Tech Stack

- **Electron 35** + **electron-vite** (Vite-based build)
- **React 19** + **React Router 7** + **TypeScript 5.9**
- **TailwindCSS 4** + **Lucide React** (icons)
- **Zustand** (state management)
- **better-sqlite3** (two SQLite databases: mods-cache.db, stats.db)
- **pnpm** (package manager)

```

## Architecture

Electron multi-process: Main (Node.js backend) <-> Preload (context bridge) <-> Renderer (React UI).

- UI calls `window.electronAPI.*` methods exposed by preload
- Main process handles file I/O, SQLite, external APIs, archive extraction
- Renderer uses Zustand stores for state, React Router for navigation
- Context isolation enabled, nodeIntegration disabled

## Dev Commands

```bash
pnpm install                                      # Install dependencies
pnpm exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3   # Rebuild native SQLite module
pnpm dev                                          # Dev server with HMR (localhost:5173)
pnpm build                                        # Build bundles
pnpm lint                                         # ESLint
pnpm package:linux                                # Package for Linux (AppImage + deb)
pnpm package:win                                  # Package for Windows (NSIS + portable)
```

## Databases (runtime, in app userData dir)

- **mods-cache.db** - GameBanana mod catalog cache with FTS5 search. Tables: `mods`, `mods_fts`, `sync_state`
- **stats.db** - Player stats. Tables: `players`, `mmr_snapshots`, `match_history`, `hero_stats_snapshots`, `aggregated_stats`, `stats_settings`

Both use WAL mode with foreign keys enabled.

## Key Config Files

- `electron.vite.config.ts` - Three Vite builds: main (Node), preload (CJS), renderer (React)
- `electron-builder.yml` - Packaging targets and auto-update config
- `tsconfig.json` / `tsconfig.app.json` / `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript configs (strict mode)
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint 9 flat config with TypeScript + React plugins

## No Tests

No test framework or test files. Quality relies on TypeScript strict mode and ESLint.

## Documentation

Design docs and references live in `docs/`:

- `profile-spec.md` - The portable profile format (`mp1:` share codes, `.modprofile.json`). Read this before touching `electron/main/services/portableProfile.ts` or the import/export UI.
- `gamebanana_api_reference.md` + `gamebanana_categories_reference.md` - GameBanana API contract notes
- `deadlock-api-architecture.md` + `DEADLOCK_STATS_API.md` - deadlock-api.com integration
- `design-overhaul-brief.md` - UI design language reference
- `social-architecture.md` + `social-architecture-decisions.md` - Architecture and ADRs for the planned `grimoire-social` companion service (see below)
- `ability-vfx-recolor.md` - Hero ability VFX layer extraction + in app recoloring. Read before touching `detectVfxLayer`/`extractVfxLayer` (in `vpk.ts`/`modMerger.ts`) or building the recolor/Locker surface. Covers why particle recolor must use an in place scalar patch, not a KV3 re-encode.
- `deadworks-servers.md` - The Deadworks server browser: relay data flow, content provisioning, and (critically) how the deadworks content path is woven into grimoire's canonical `gameinfo.gi` block so Fix Configuration never erases it. Read before touching `deadworksServers.ts`, `ipc/servers.ts`, or the gameinfo handling in `system.ts`/`deadlock.ts`.

## Companion Service: grimoire-social

The planned social layer (publish profiles, browse, like) lives in a separate repo at `../grimoire-social`. It's a Cloudflare Worker (Hono + D1 + KV + Durable Objects) consumed exclusively by this desktop client.

When you're working on social features in this repo:

- Wire format types are defined in `../grimoire-social/src/shared/schemas.ts` (Zod). The Electron client should import from there to stay in sync; never drift the types.
- All social API routes are prefixed `/v1/`. Versioning is locked — additive-only changes (see `../grimoire-social/CLAUDE.md`).
- The session token (returned by Steam OpenID auth) lives in the main process via `safeStorage` (async API; refuse to persist on Linux without libsecret). **The renderer must never see the token.** New IPC handlers in `electron/main/ipc/social.ts` will attach the bearer in the main process.
- Social UI lives in `src/pages/Discover.tsx` (planned) and `src/components/social/` (planned). Existing `src/components/profiles/ImportProfileDialog.tsx` is reused as the import surface from a discovered profile.

If the parent design needs to change (API surface, schema, identity provider), update `docs/social-architecture.md` and add an ADR to `docs/social-architecture-decisions.md` rather than editing existing ADRs.

## Internationalization (i18n)

i18next + react-i18next. `src/i18n.ts` eagerly globs `src/locales/*/translation.json`, so adding a language is purely a catalog drop, no code change.

- **`src/locales/en/translation.json` is the source of truth and the only translatable catalog.** It must contain *only* real, displayed strings (keys actually referenced by `t()`/`<Tx>`). It is what Weblate (grimoire-translate) translates.
- **`src/locales/unwired-en.json` is an English-only staging file**, never translated and never bundled at runtime (the glob only matches `*/translation.json`). It holds `unwired.*` keys: a developer to-do list of hardcoded strings still to be wired. `pnpm i18n:extract-unwired -- --merge` appends candidates here. Wiring a string means giving it a real key in `translation.json` and deleting the `unwired.*` entry. Keeping these out of `translation.json` is what stops Weblate from showing translators strings that are never displayed and keeps the completeness percentage honest.
- **Translation round-trip (the leg that's easy to forget):** en strings reach translators only after they land on `main`; finished translations come back on a `translations/<lang>` branch (e.g. `origin/translations/he`), which must be **merged to `main`** and then `pnpm i18n:manifest` run to regenerate `src/locales/manifest.json`. The app fetches that manifest + each catalog from `raw.githubusercontent.com/Slush97/grimoire/main` on demand (download-on-demand language packs, ETag-refreshed on startup; see `electron/main/services/localeDownload.ts`). **Until a `translations/*` branch is merged, the picker offers English only**, however complete the catalog is on the Weblate side.
- **Gates (CI `ci.yml` + husky `pre-push`):** `pnpm i18n:check` (every referenced key must exist in en) and `gen-locale-manifest.mjs --check` (committed manifest must match the catalogs). Regenerate the manifest with `pnpm i18n:manifest` after any catalog change. Whether new keys auto-sync *into* Weblate depends on the Weblate component's repo-pull setting (webhook/poll), which lives on the Weblate server, not in this repo.

## Conventions

- **No em-dashes** anywhere - in UI strings, comments, or replies. Substitute colon, period, or parens.
- **Portable profile format is Grimoire-only.** Don't claim compatibility with other mod managers in copy.
- **Two-process security**: main process owns secrets (API keys, session tokens); renderer talks to main via IPC. Don't expose secrets to the renderer.
- **Rate limiters in `electron/main/services/rateLimiter.ts`** wrap external API calls (GameBanana 10 req/sec, deadlock-api 5 req/sec). New external integrations should reuse this pattern.
