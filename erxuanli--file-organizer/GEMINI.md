> Build a modern desktop GUI application in Python that sorts PDF files into

Build a modern desktop GUI application in Python that sorts PDF files into
AI-generated categories based on their content, using a local Ollama LLM.
No external API calls, no API keys, fully offline.

## Framework and packaging

- GUI framework: customtkinter (modern, light/dark mode aware, pip installable).
- Use pyproject.toml with project name `pdf-sorter`, requiring Python >= 3.10.
- Dependencies: customtkinter, pymupdf, ollama, rapidfuzz, Pillow.
- Entry point: python -m pdf_sorter  (launches the GUI window).
- Also provide a platform-specific launcher in the README:
    macOS/Linux: a one-line shell script  `run.sh`  containing  `python -m pdf_sorter`
    Windows:     a  `run.bat`  file doing the same.
- Package structure:
    pdf_sorter/
        __init__.py
        __main__.py      # calls app.run()
        app.py           # main App class, window setup, view switching
        views/
            __init__.py
            setup_view.py     # configuration panel (Step 1)
            progress_view.py  # live progress panel (Step 2)
            preview_view.py   # categorization results table (Step 3)
            done_view.py      # final summary (Step 4)
        backend/
            __init__.py
            extract.py        # PDF text extraction
            categorize.py     # Ollama LLM inference
            normalize.py      # label normalization with rapidfuzz
            files.py          # file moving and collision handling
            log.py            # sort_log.txt writing
        worker.py             # background thread orchestration

## Application flow

The app is a single window (min 720 x 600 px, resizable) that steps through four
views. The active view fills the window. Navigation between views is handled by
app.py's show_view(view_name) method.

---

### View 1 — Setup (setup_view.py)

This is what the user sees on launch. All configuration happens here.

Layout (top to bottom):

  [App title: "PDF Sorter"]
  [Subtitle: "Sort your PDFs into folders using a local AI"]

  INPUT FOLDER
  [Text field showing selected path]  [Browse... button]
  (opens a native folder picker dialog via tkinter.filedialog.askdirectory)

  OUTPUT FOLDER
  [Text field showing selected path, pre-filled with <input_dir>/sorted/]  [Browse... button]
  Hint text below: "Category subfolders will be created here."

  OLLAMA MODEL
  [Dropdown (CTkComboBox) listing available local models]  [Refresh button ↺]
  The dropdown is populated by calling `ollama list` via the ollama Python package
  on view load and on Refresh. If no models are found, show:
  "No models found. Run: ollama pull llama3.2:3b" in red below the dropdown.
  If Ollama is not running, show:
  "Ollama is not running. Start it with: ollama serve" in red.
  Recommended models hint (static, always visible):
  "Recommended: llama3.2:3b (8 GB RAM) · llama3.1:8b (16 GB RAM)"

  CATEGORY HINTS  (optional)
  Label: "Preferred categories (optional)"
  [Text field]  [+ Add button]
  Below the field: a wrapping row of removable chip/tag widgets for each added hint.
  Each chip has an × button to remove it.
  Hint text: "Guide the AI toward these categories. Leave empty for fully automatic."

  ADVANCED OPTIONS  [collapsible section, collapsed by default]
    Parallel extraction workers: [Slider 1–8, default 4, integer label beside it]
    Dry run (preview only):      [Toggle switch]

  [Start Sorting  →  button, full-width, accent color, disabled until input_dir is set]

On clicking Start Sorting:
  1. Validate that input_dir exists and contains at least one PDF. If not, show an
     inline error below the input field.
  2. Validate Ollama is running and selected model is available. If not, show inline
     error below the model dropdown.
  3. If output_dir already contains sort_log.txt, show a modal dialog:
     "This output folder was used before. Continue anyway?" [Yes] [Cancel]
  4. If all checks pass, switch to View 2.

---

### View 2 — Processing (progress_view.py)

Shown while extraction and categorization are running. The user cannot go back.
A Cancel button aborts gracefully (finishes the current file, then stops).

Layout:

  [Title: "Sorting your PDFs..."]

  Extraction
  [Progress bar]  "34 / 100 files"
  [Current file label: "Extracting: quarterly_report.pdf"]

  Categorization
  [Progress bar]  "12 / 100 files"
  [Current file label: "Categorizing: quarterly_report.pdf"]  [model name badge]

  [Scrollable log area showing one line per completed file:]
    ✓  invoice_jan.pdf       →  Invoice
    ✓  gpt4_paper.pdf        →  Research Paper
    ✗  scan001.pdf           →  Uncategorized  (no extractable text)

  [Cancel button, right-aligned]

The log area uses monospaced font. Green ✓ for successfully categorized, orange ✗
for Uncategorized. Each new line is appended as it completes; the area auto-scrolls.

All processing runs in a background thread (worker.py) and posts updates to the GUI
via a thread-safe queue that the GUI polls with app.after(50, poll_queue).

On completion (or after cancel): switch to View 3.

---

### View 3 — Preview (preview_view.py)

Shows the categorization results before any files are moved.
If dry-run mode is on, the "Move Files" button is hidden and a "Dry Run" badge is
shown instead.

Layout:

  [Title: "Ready to move files"]  or  [Title: "Dry run complete"]

  Summary badges in a row:
    [N files found]  [M categories]  [K uncategorized]

  [Scrollable table with columns:]
    Category | Files | Filenames (first 3, then "…and N more")

  Each row is alternately shaded. Uncategorized row (if any) is shown last in muted
  color.

  Clicking a row expands it inline to show all filenames in that category.

  Below the table:
    [← Back to Setup]  (returns to View 1 with all settings preserved)
    [Move N files  →]  (accent color, hidden in dry-run mode)

On clicking Move N files:
  A small modal confirms: "Move N files into <output_dir>? This cannot be undone."
  [Confirm]  [Cancel]
  On Confirm: run file-moving in a background thread with a simple progress modal
  (a progress bar in a small overlay dialog). Then switch to View 4.

---

### View 4 — Done (done_view.py)

Layout:

  [Large checkmark icon]
  [Title: "All done!"]
  [Subtitle: "N files sorted into M categories"]

  [Open output folder button]  — opens the output directory in Finder/Explorer/Nautilus
  [Sort more PDFs button]      — resets to View 1 with a clean state
  [View log button]            — opens sort_log.txt in the system default text editor

---

## Backend logic (backend/)

### extract.py
- extract_text(pdf_path: Path) -> tuple[str, str | None]
  Returns (text_excerpt, error_reason | None).
  Strategy:
    1. Prepend metadata if available: "Title: ...\nSubject: ...\n---\n"
    2. Page 1: up to 800 words.
    3. Pages 2–3: up to 400 words each.
    4. Further pages until 2000 words total.
  If zero text extracted: return ("", "no extractable text").

### categorize.py
- categorize(text: str, model: str, hints: list[str]) -> str
  Calls the Ollama chat API with:
    System prompt:
      "You are a document classification assistant. Assign the document a single
       short category label. Rules: output the label only — no explanation, no
       punctuation, no bullet points. 2 to 4 words, Title Case.
       <if hints non-empty:>
       Prefer one of these categories if the document fits: <hint1>, <hint2>, ..."
    User message: text excerpt.
    Temperature: 0.1
  Parse: strip whitespace and punctuation, take first line only. If result is
  empty or more than 5 words, return "Uncategorized".
  On any exception: return "Uncategorized" and log the error.

### normalize.py
- normalize_labels(assignments: dict[Path, str]) -> dict[Path, str]
  1. Cluster labels using rapidfuzz.fuzz.ratio >= 85%.
  2. Canonical label = most frequent in each cluster.
  3. If a cluster's canonical label fuzzy-matches a user hint (>= 80%), replace with
     the exact hint string.
  Returns updated assignments dict.

### files.py
- move_file(src: Path, dst_dir: Path) -> Path
  Creates dst_dir if needed. Handles collisions with _2, _3 suffix.
  Returns the actual destination path used.

### log.py
- write_log(entries: list[LogEntry], output_dir: Path) -> None
  Writes sort_log.txt. One pipe-delimited line per file:
  ISO_TIMESTAMP | source_path | category | destination_path | status

### worker.py
- SortWorker(threading.Thread)
  Runs the full pipeline: extract → categorize → normalize → (optionally) move.
  Posts progress events to a queue.Queue for the GUI to consume:
    {"type": "extract_progress", "current": n, "total": N, "filename": "..."}
    {"type": "extract_done", "filename": "...", "success": bool}
    {"type": "categorize_progress", "current": n, "total": N, "filename": "..."}
    {"type": "categorize_done", "filename": "...", "category": "...", "ok": bool}
    {"type": "normalize_done", "assignments": {...}}
    {"type": "move_progress", "current": n, "total": N}
    {"type": "done", "summary": {...}}
    {"type": "error", "message": "..."}
    {"type": "cancelled"}

## Code quality

- Type-annotate all functions.
- Docstring on every public function.
- Use pathlib throughout; never use os.path.
- Never use bare except; always catch specific exceptions.
- No function longer than 40 lines; extract helpers freely.
- Keep all GUI code in views/; keep all business logic in backend/.
  Views must import from backend but backend must never import from views.
- GUI updates from background threads must only happen via the queue; never call
  GUI methods directly from a non-main thread.

## README.md

Structure:
1. What it does (2–3 sentences) and a screenshot placeholder.
2. Requirements: Python >= 3.10, RAM recommendations per model.
3. Install Ollama and pull a model (exact commands).
4. Install pdf-sorter:  pip install -e .
5. Launch:  python -m pdf_sorter  (or double-click run.sh / run.bat).
6. Step-by-step walkthrough of the four views with brief descriptions.
7. Troubleshooting: Ollama not running, model not pulled, no text extracted,
   frozen window (should not happen, but link to filing an issue).
